"The purpose of this contribution is to give a coherent account of a particular narrative which links locales, geometric theories, sheaf semantics and constructive commutative algebra. We are hoping to convey a firm grasp of three ideas: (1) Locales are a kind of space in which opens instead of points are fundamental. (2) Sheaf semantics allows us to explore mathematical objects from custom-tailored mathematical universes. (3) Without loss of generality, any reduced ring is a field."
"Spectrum constructions appear throughout mathematics as a way of constructing topological spaces from algebraic data. Given a commutative localic semiring R (the pointfree analogue of a topological semiring), we define a spectrum of R which generalises the Stone spectrum of a distributive lattice, the Zariski spectrum of a commutative ring, the Gelfand spectrum of a commutative unital C*-algebra and the Hofmann-Lawson spectrum of a continuous frame. We then provide an explicit construction of this spectrum under conditions on R which are satisfied by our main examples.   Our results are constructively valid and hence admit interpretation in any elementary topos with natural number object. For this reason the spectrum we construct should actually be a locale instead of a topological space.   A simple modification to our construction gives rise to a quantic spectrum in the form of a commutative quantale. Such a quantale contains `differential' information in addition to the purely topological information of the localic spectrum. In the case of a discrete ring, our construction produces the quantale of ideals.   This prompts us to study the quantale of ideals in more detail. We discuss some results from abstract ideal theory in the setting of quantales and provide a tentative definition for what it might mean for a quantale to be nonsingular by analogy to commutative ring theory."
"A lattice L is coordinatizable, if it is isomorphic to the lattice L(R) of principal right ideals of some von Neumann regular ring R. This forces L to be complemented modular. All known sufficient conditions for coordinatizability, due first to J. von Neumann, then to B. Jonsson, are first-order. Nevertheless, we prove that coordinatizability of lattices is not first-order, by finding a non-coordinatizable lattice K with a coordinatizable countable elementary extension L. This solves a 1960 problem of B. Jonsson. We also prove that there is no L\_{infinity, infinity} statement equivalent to coordinatizability. Furthermore, the class of coordinatizable lattices is not closed under countable directed unions; this solves another problem of B. Jonsson from 1962."
"This is an expository paper in which I explain how core mathematics, particularly abstract analysis, can be developed within a concrete countable set J_2 (the second set in Jensen's constructible hierarchy). The implication, well-known to proof theorists but probably not to most mainstream mathematicians, is that ordinary mathematical practice does not require an enigmatic metaphysical universe of sets. I go further and argue that J_2 is a superior setting for normal mathematics because it is free of irrelevant set-theoretic pathologies and permits stronger formulations of existence results."
"This paper provides a conceptual study of the twisting procedure, which amounts to create functorially new differential graded Lie algebras, associative algebras or operads (as well as their homotopy versions) from a Maurer--Cartan element. On the way, we settle the integration theory of complete pre-Lie algebras in order to describe this twisting procedure in terms of gauge group action. We give a criterion on quadratic operads for the existence of a meaningful twisting procedure of their associated categories of (homotopy) algebras. We also give a new presentation of the twisting procedure for operads \`a la Willwacher and we perform new homology computations of graph complexes."
"Building on Retakh's approach to Ext groups through categories of extensions, Schwede reobtained the well-known Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Ext groups over bimodules of associative algebras both from splicing extensions (leading to the cup product) and from a suitable loop in the categories of extensions (leading to the Lie bracket). We show how Schwede's construction admits a vast generalisation to general monoidal categories with coefficients of the Ext groups taken in (weak) left and right monoidal (or Drinfel'd) centres. In case of the category of left modules over bialgebroids and coefficients given by commuting pairs of braided (co)commutative (co)monoids in these categorical centres, we provide an explicit description of the algebraic structure obtained this way, and a complete proof that this leads to a Gerstenhaber algebra is then obtained from an operadic approach. This, in particular, considerably generalises the classical construction given by Gerstenhaber himself. Conjecturally, the algebraic structure we describe should produce a Gerstenhaber algebra for an arbitrary monoidal category enriched over abelian groups, but even the bilinearity of the cup product and of the Lie-type bracket defined by the abstract construction in terms of extension categories remain elusive in this general setting."
"This monograph provides an overview on the Maurer-Cartan methods in algebra, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. It offers a conceptual, exhaustive and gentle treatment of the twisting procedure, which functorially creates new differential graded Lie algebras, associative algebras or operads (as well as their homotopy versions) from a Maurer-Cartan element. The twisting procedure for (homotopy) associative algebras or (homotopy) Lie algebras is described by means of the action of the biggest deformation gauge group ever considered. We give a criterion on quadratic operads for the existence of a meaningful twisting procedure of their associated categories of algebras. And, we introduce the twisting procedure for operads \`a la Willwacher using a new and simpler presentation, which provides us with a wide source of motivating examples related to graph homology, both recovering known graph complexes (due to Kontsevich) and introducing some new ones. This book starts with elementary surveys on gauge theory and deformation theory using differential graded Lie algebras in order to ease the way to the theory. It finishes with concise surveys on the fundamental theorem of deformation theory, higher Lie theory, rational homotopy theory, simplicial theory of homotopy algebras, and the Floer cohomology of Lagrangian submanifolds, to illustrate deep examples of applications."
"We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product (this action is more or less equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with an ""abstract"" Calabi-Yau manifold)."
"We carry out a systematic, topos-theoretically inspired, investigation of Wallman compactifications with a particular emphasis on their relations with Gelfand spectra and Stone-Cech compactifications. In addition to proving several specific results about Wallman bases and maximal spectra of distributive lattices, we establish a general framework for functorializing the representation of a topological space as the maximal spectrum of a Wallman base for it, which allows to generate different dualities between categories of topological spaces and subcategories of the category of distributive lattices; in particular, this leads to a categorical equivalence between the category of commutative C*-algebras and a natural category of distributive lattices. We also establish a general theorem concerning the representation of the Stone-Cech compactification of a locale as a Wallman compactification, which subsumes all the previous results obtained on this problem."
"We introduce syzygies for derived categories and study their properties. Using these, we prove the derived invariance of the following classes of artin algebras: (1) syzygy-finite algebras, (2) Igusa-Todorov algebras, (3) AC algebras, (4) algebras satisfying the finitistic Auslander conjecture, and (5) algebras satisfying the generalized Auslander-Reiten conjecture. In particular, Gorenstein CM-finite algebras are derived invariants."
"Let A, B, S be categories, let F:A-->S and G:B-->S be functors. We assume that for ""many"" objects a in A, there exists an object b in B such that F(a) is isomorphic to G(b). We establish a general framework under which it is possible to transfer this statement to diagrams of A. These diagrams are all indexed by posets in which every principal ideal is a join-semilattice and the set of all upper bounds of any finite subset is a finitely generated upper subset. Various consequences follow, in particular: (1) The Gr\""atzer-Schmidt Theorem, which states that every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra, can be extended to finite poset-indexed diagrams of algebraic lattices and compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphisms (and no finiteness restriction if there are large enough cardinals). (2) In a host of situations, the relative critical point between two locally finite quasivarieties is either less than aleph omega or equal to infinity. (3) A lattice of cardinality aleph 1 may not have any congruence-permutable, congruence-preserving extension."
"A sectionally complemented modular lattice L is coordinatizable if it is isomorphic to the lattice L(R) of all principal right ideals of some von Neumann regular (not necessarily unital) ring R. We say that L has a large 4-frame if it has a homogeneous sequence (a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3) such that the neutral ideal generated by a_0 is L. J\'onsson proved in 1962 that if L has a countable cofinal sequence and a large 4-frame, then it is coordinatizable; whether the cofinal sequence assumption could be dispensed with was left open. We solve this problem by finding a non-coordinatizable sectionally complemented modular lattice L with a large 4-frame; it has cardinality aleph one. Furthermore, L is an ideal in a (necessarily coordinatizable) complemented modular lattice with a spanning 5-frame. Our proof uses Banaschewski functions. A Banaschewski function on a bounded lattice L is an antitone self-map of L that picks a complement for each element of L. In an earlier paper, we proved that every countable complemented modular lattice has a Banaschewski function. We prove that there exists a unit-regular ring R of cardinality aleph one and index of nilpotence 3 such that L(R) has no Banaschewski function."
"We survey some topics in ${\mathbb A}^1$-homotopy theory. Our main goal is to highlight the interplay between ${\mathbb A}^1$-homotopy theory and affine algebraic geometry, focusing on the varieties that are ""contractible"" from various standpoints."
"The following natural question arises from Shalom's innovational work (1999, Publ. IHES): ""Can we establish an intrinsic criterion to synthesize relative fixed point properties into the whole fixed point property without assuming Bounded Generation?"" This paper resolves this question in the affirmative. Our criterion works for ones with respect to certain classes of Busemann NPC spaces. It, moreover, suggests a further step toward constructing super-expanders from finite simple groups of Lie type."
"We provide an overview of the mathematical work of K.S.S. Nambooripad, with a focus on his contributions to the theory of regular semigroups. In particular, we outline Nambooripad's seminal contributions to the structure theory of regular semigroups via his theory of {\em inductive groupoids}, and also via his theory of {\em cross connections}. We also provide information about outgrowths of his work in the algebraic theory of semigroups and its connections with several other fields of mathematics, in particular with the theory of operator algebras."
"We study to what extent group $C^\ast$-algebras are characterized by their unitary groups. A complete characterization of which Abelian group $C^\ast$-algebras have isomorphic unitary groups is obtained. We compare these results with other unitary-related invariants of $C^\ast(\Gamma)$, such as the $K$-theoretic $K_1(C^\ast(\Gamma))$ and find that $C^\ast$-algebras of nonisomorphic torsion-free Abelian groups may have isomorphic $K_1$-groups, in sharp contrast with the well-known fact that $C^\ast(\Gamma)$ (even $\Gamma$) is characterized by the topological group structure of its unitary group when $\Gamma $ is torsion-free and Abelian."
"Order and symmetry are main structural principles in mathematics. We give five examples where on the face of it order is not apparent, but deeper investigations reveal that they are governed by order structures. These examples are finite topologies, associative algebras, subgroups of matrix groups, ideals in polynomial rings, and classes of bipartite graphs."
"It is well known that under some general conditions right Bousfield localization exists. We provide general conditions under which right Bousfield localization yields a monoidal model category. Then we address the questions of when this monoidal model structure on a right Bousfield localization induces a model structure on the category of algebras over a colored operad and when a right Bousfield localization preserves colored operadic algebras. We give numerous applications, to topological spaces, equivariant spaces, chain complexes, stable module categories, and to the category of small categories. We recover a wide range of classical results as special cases of our theory, and prove several new preservation results."
"The purpose of this foundational paper is to introduce various notions and constructions in order to develop the homotopy theory for differential graded operads over any ring. The main new idea is to consider the action of the symmetric groups as part of the defining structure of an operad and not as the underlying category. We introduce a new dual category of higher cooperads, a new higher bar-cobar adjunction with the category of operads, and a new higher notion of homotopy operads, for which we establish the relevant homotopy properties. For instance, the higher bar-cobar construction provides us with a cofibrant replacement functor for operads over any ring. All these constructions are produced conceptually by applying the curved Koszul duality for colored operads. This paper is a first step toward a new Koszul duality theory for operads, where the action of the symmetric groups is properly taken into account."
"We provide a direct and elementary proof of the fact that the category of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces is dually equivalent to an Aleph_1-ary variety of algebras. Further, we show that Aleph_1 is a sharp bound: compact ordered spaces are not dually equivalent to any SP-class of finitary algebras."
"We unify several extensions of the classic Stone duality due to Gr\""atzer, Hoffman-Lawson and Jung-S\""underhauf. Specifically we show that U-bases of locally compact sober spaces are dual to <-distributive v-predomains, where < is a transitive relation representing compact containment."
"While chain complexes are equipped with a differential $d$ satisfying $d^2 = 0$, their generalizations called $N$-complexes have a differential $d$ satisfying $d^N = 0$. In this paper we show that the lax nerve of the category of chain complexes is pointwise adjoint equivalent to the d\'ecalage of the simplicial category of $N$-complexes. This reveals additional simplicial structure on the lax nerve of the category of chain complexes which provides a categorfication of the triangulated homotopy category of chain complexes. We study this phenomena in general and present evidence that the axioms of triangulated categories have simplicial origin."
"""Co-Frobenius"" coalgebras were introduced as dualizations of Frobenius algebras. Recently, it was shown in \cite{I} that they admit left-right symmetric characterizations analogue to those of Frobenius algebras: a coalgebra $C$ is co-Frobenius if and only if it is isomorphic to its rational dual. We consider the more general quasi-co-Frobenius (QcF) coalgebras; in the first main result we show that these also admit symmetric characterizations: a coalgebra is QcF if it is weakly isomorphic to its (left, or equivalently right) rational dual $Rat(C^*)$, in the sense that certain coproduct or product powers of these objects are isomorphic. These show that QcF coalgebras can be viewed as generalizations of both co-Frobenius coalgebras and Frobenius algebras. Surprisingly, these turn out to have many applications to fundamental results of Hopf algebras. The equivalent characterizations of Hopf algebras with left (or right) nonzero integrals as left (or right) co-Frobenius, or QcF, or semiperfect or with nonzero rational dual all follow immediately from these results. Also, the celebrated uniqueness of integrals follows at the same time as just another equivalent statement. Moreover, as a by-product of our methods, we observe a short proof for the bijectivity of the antipode of a Hopf algebra with nonzero integral. This gives a purely representation theoretic approach to many of the basic fundamental results in the theory of Hopf algebras."
We prove that relative functors out of a cofibration category are essentially the same as relative functors which are only defined on the subcategory of cofibrations. As an application we give a new construction of the functor that assigns to a groupoid its groupoid $C^*$-algebra and thereby its topological $K$-theory spectrum.
"We present updates to the problems on Hirzebruch's 1954 problem list focussing on open problems, and on those where substantial progress has been made in recent years. We discuss some purely topological problems, as well as geometric problems about (almost) complex structures, both algebraic and non-algebraic, about contact structures, and about (complementary pairs of) foliations."
"Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces, analogous to the Euler characteristic of topological spaces and the cardinality of sets. The definition of magnitude is a special case of a general categorical definition that clarifies the analogies between various cardinality-like invariants in mathematics. Although this motivation is a world away from geometric measure, magnitude, when applied to subsets of R^n, turns out to be intimately related to invariants such as volume, surface area, perimeter and dimension. We describe several aspects of this relationship, providing evidence for a conjecture (first stated in arXiv:0908.1582) that magnitude subsumes all the most important invariants of classical integral geometry."
"We introduce large scale analogues of topological monotone and light maps, which we call coarsely monotone and coarsely light maps respectively. We show that these two classes of maps constitute a factorization system on the coarse category. We also show how coarsely monotone maps arise from a reflection in a similar way to classically monotone maps, and prove that coarsely monotone maps are stable under those pullbacks which exist in the coarse category. For the case of maps between proper metric spaces, we exhibit some connections between the coarse and classical notions of monotone and light using the Higson corona. Finally, we look at some coarse properties which are preserved by coarsely light maps such as finite asymptotic dimension and exactness, and make some remarks on the situation for groups and group homomorphisms."
"We develop a theory that may be considered as a prequel to the coarse theory. We are viewing ends of spaces as extra points at infinity. In order to discuss behaviour of spaces at infinity one needs a concept (a measure) of approaching infinity. The simplest way to do so is to list subsets of $X$ that are bounded (i.e. far from infinity) and that list should satisfy certain basic properties. Such a list $S_X$ we call a \textbf{scale} on a set $X$ (see Section 3). In order to use ideas from the Stone Duality Theorem we consider sub-Boolean algebras $BA_X$ of the power set $2^X$ of $X$ that contain $S_X$ and that leads naturally to the concept of ends of a \textbf{scaled Boolean algebra} $(X,S_X,BA_X)$ which can be attached to $X$ and form a new scaled Boolean algebra $(\bar X,S_X,\overline{BA_X})$ that is \textbf{compact at infinity}.   Given a scaled space $(X,S_X)$ the most natural scaled Boolean algebra is $(X,S_X,2^X)$ which can be too far removed from the geometry of $X$. Therefore we need to figure out how to trim $2^X$ to a smaller sub-Boolean algebra $BA_X$. More generally, how to trim a sub-Boolean algebra $BA_X$ to a smaller one. That is done using ideas from linear algebra. Namely, we consider a family $\mathcal{F}$ of naturally arising $S_X$-linear operators on $BA_X$ and the smaller sub-Boolean algebra $BA_{\mathcal{F}}$ consists of eigensets of $\mathcal{F}$, an analog of eigenvectors from linear algebra. We show that all ends defined in literature so far (Freundenthal ends, ends of finitely generated groups, Specker ends, Cornulier ends, ends of coarse spaces) are special cases of such a process."
The main theorem in this paper is that the base change functor from a noetherian abelian category to its noetherian polynomial category induces an isomorphism on K-theory. The main theorem implies the well-known fact that A^1-homotopy invariance of K'-theory for noetherian schemes.
"We define a group $RBr(\mathcal{G})$ containing, in a sense, the graded complex and orthogonal Brauer groups of a locally compact groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ equipped with an involution. When the involution is trivial, we show that the new group naturally provides a generalization of Donovan-Karoubi's graded orthogonal Brauer group $GBrO$. More generally, it is shown to be a direct summand of the well-known graded complex Brauer goup. In addition, we prove that $RBr(\mathcal{G})$ identifies with a direct sum of a Real cohomology group and the abelian group $RExt(\mathcal{G},U(1))$ of Real graded $U(1)$-central extensions. A cohomological picture is then given."
"We reformulate the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients by introducing a new crossed product functor for C*-algebras. All confirming examples for the original Baum-Connes conjecture remain confirming examples for the reformulated conjecture, and at present there are no known counterexamples to the reformulated conjecture. Moreover, some of the known expander-based counterexamples to the original Baum-Connes conjecture become confirming examples for our reformulated conjecture."
"We study integer-graded cohomology rings defined over Calabi-Yau categories. We show that the cohomology in negative degree is a trivial extension of the cohomology ring in non-negative degree, provided the latter admits a regular sequence of central elements of length two. In particular, the product of elements of negative degrees are zero. As corollaries we apply this to Tate-Hochschild cohomology rings of symmetric algebras, and to Tate cohomology rings over group algebras. We also prove similar results for Tate cohomology rings over commutative local Gorenstein rings."
"It is proved that if a ring is left hereditary, left perfect and right coherent, then the stable category has cokernels. Moreover, we show that the condition for a ring to be left perfect and right coherent is also necessary for the stable category to have cokernels, provided that the ring is left hereditary and satisfies the additional condition that there are no non-trivial projective injective left modules over it (satisfied, for instance, by integral domains). This, in particular, implies that, for a Dedekind domain, the stable category has cokernels if and only if the domain is left perfect. Several new necessary and sufficient conditions for a left hereditary ring to be left perfect and right coherent are found. One of them requires that the full subcategory of projective modules be reflective in the category of modules. Another one requires that any module be isomorphic to a stable module in the stable category. Yet another equivalent condition found in the paper requires that, for any module $M$, among all representations $M=K\oplus P$ with a projective $P$, there should be the one with the smallest $K$. To accomplish the goals, a version of the well-known Freyd's adjoint functor theorem, where the solution set condition is removed under some additional conditions on the categories, is given."
"We use elementary methods to compute the L2-dimension of the eigenspaces of the Markov operator on the lamplighter group and of generalizations of this operator on other groups. In particular, we give a transparent explanation of the spectral measure of the Markov operator on the lamplighter group found by Grigorchuk-Zuk. The latter result was used by Grigorchuk-Linnell-Schick-Zuk to produce a counterexample to a strong version of the Atiyah conjecture about the range of L2-Betti numbers. We use our results to construct manifolds with certain L2-Betti numbers (given as convergent infinite sums of rational numbers) which are not obviously rational, but we have been unable to determine whether any of them are irrational."
"The ""zero in the spectrum conjecture"" asserted (in its strongest form) that for any manifold M zero should be in the l2-spectrum of the Laplacian (on forms) of the universal covering of M, i.e. that at least one (unreduced) L2-cohomology group of (the universal covering of) M is non-zero.   Farber and Weinberger gave the first counterexamples to this conjecture. In this paper, using their fundamental idea to show the following stronger version of this result:   Let G be a finitely presented group and suppose that the homology groups H_k(G,\ell^2(G)) are zero for k=0,1,2. For every dimension n\ge 6 there is a closed manifold M of dimension n and with fundamental group G such that the L2-cohomology of (the universal covering of) M vanishes in all degrees."
This is a paper in Analytic Topology.
"Projectivity and injectivity are fundamental notions in category theory. We consider natural weakenings termed semiprojectivity and semiinjectivity, and study these concepts in different categories.   For example, in the category of metric spaces, (semi)injective objects are precisely the absolute (neighborhood) retracts. We show that the trivial group is the only semiinjective group, while every free product of a finitely presented group and a free group is semiprojective.   To a compact, metric space $X$ we associate the commutative C*-algebra $C(X)$. This association is contravariant, whence semiinjectivity of $X$ is related to semiprojectivity of $C(X)$. Together with Adam S{\o}rensen, we showed that $C(X)$ is semiprojective in the category of all C*-algebras if and only if $X$ is an absolute neighborhood retract with dimension at most one."
"We introduce a K\""unneth class in the quantum equivariant setting inspired by the pioneer work by J. Chabert, H. Oyono-Oyono and S. Echterhoff, which allows to relate the quantum Baum-Connes property with the K\""unneth formula by generalising some key results of Chabert-Oyono-Oyono-Echterhoff to discrete quantum groups. Finally, we make the observation that the C$^*$-algebra defining a compact quantum group with dual satisfying the strong quantum Baum-Connes property belongs to the K\""unneth class. This allows to obtain some K-theory computations for quantum direct products based on earlier work by Voigt and Vergnioux-Voigt."
"Given a two-dimensional substitution tiling space, we show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the $K$-theory of the groupoid $C^\ast$-algebra of its unstable groupoid can be explicitly reconstructed from the $K$-theory of the $AF$-algebras of the substitution rule and its analogue on the $1$-skeleton. We prove this by generalizing the calculations done for the chair tiling in [JS16] using relative $K$-theory and excision, and packaging the result into an exact sequence purely in topology. From this exact sequence, it appears that one cannot use only ordinary $K$-theory to compute using the dimension-filtration on the unstable groupoid. Several examples are computed using Sage and the results are compiled in a table."
"We introduce the notion of wide representation of an inverse semigroup and prove that with a suitably defined topology there is a space of germs of such a representation which has the structure of an etale groupoid. This gives an elegant description of Paterson's universal groupoid and of the translation groupoid of Skandalis, Tu, and Yu. In addition we characterize the inverse semigroups that arise from groupoids, leading to a precise bijection between the class of etale groupoids and the class of complete and infinitely distributive inverse monoids equipped with suitable representations, and we explain the sense in which quantales and localic groupoids carry a generalization of this correspondence."
"Given an upward directed set $I$ we consider surjective $I$-inverse systems $\{X_\al,f_{\al\be}:X_\be\lra X_\al| \al\leq\be\in I\}$, namely those inverse systems that have all $f_{\al\be}$ surjective. A number of properties of $I$-inverse systems have been investigated; such are the Mittag-Leffler condition, investigated by Grothendieck and flabby and semi-flabby $I$-inverse systems studied by Jensen. We note that flabby implies semi-flabby implies surjective implies Mittag-Leffler. Some of the results about surjective inverse systems have been known for some time. The aim of this note is to give a series of equivalent statements and implications involving surjective inverse systems and the systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition, together with improvements of established results, as well as their relationships with the already known, but scattered facts. The most prominent results relate cardinalities of the index sets with right exactness of the inverse limit functor and the non-vanishing of the inverse limit -- connections related to cohomological dimensions."
"We prove for a large family of rings R that their lambda-pure global dimension is greater than one for each infinite regular cardinal lambda. This answers in negative a problem posed by Rosicky. The derived categories of such rings then do not satisfy the Adams lambda-representability for morphisms for any lambda. Equivalently, they are examples of well generated triangulated categories whose lambda-abelianization in the sense of Neeman is not a full functor for any lambda. In particular we show that given a compactly generated triangulated category, one may not be able to find a Rosicky functor among the lambda-abelianization functors."
We show that extension groups between two polynomial functors on free groups are the same in the category of all functors and in a subcategory of polynomial functors of bounded degree. We give some applications. ---- On montre que les groupes d'extensions entre foncteurs polynomiaux sur les groupes libres sont les m\^emes dans la cat\'egorie de tous les foncteurs et dans une sous-cat\'egorie de foncteurs polynomiaux de degr\'e born\'e. On donne quelques applications.
"This paper is a greatly expanded version of Section 9.11 in arXiv:1006.4343. A series of definitions and results illustrating the thesis in the title (where quasi-formality means vanishing of a certain kind of Massey multiplications in the cohomology) is presented. In particular, we include a categorical interpretation of the ""Koszulity implies $K(\pi,1)$"" claim, discuss the differences between two versions of Massey operations, and apply the derived nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory in order to deduce the main theorem. In the end we demonstrate a counterexample providing a negative answer to a question of Hopkins and Wickelgren about formality of the cochain DG-algebras of absolute Galois groups, thus showing that quasi-formality cannot be strengthened to formality in the title assertion."
"We show that the Peiffer commutator previously defined by Cigoli, Mantovani and Metere can be used to characterize central extensions of precrossed modules with respect to the subcategory of crossed modules in any semi-abelian category satisfying an additional property. We prove that this commutator also characterizes double central extensions, obtaining then some Hopf formulas for the second and third homology objects of internal precrossed modules."
"There is a lattice of torsion theories in simplicial groups such that the torsion/torsion-free categories are given by simplicial groups with truncated Moore complex below/above a certain degree. We study the restriction of these torsion theories to certain subcategories of simplicial groups. In particular, we prove that the categories of D.Conduch\'{e}'s 2-crossed modules and Ashley's crossed complexes in groups are semi-abelian and we give some descriptions of their torsion theories. These examples of torsion theories also give rise to new examples of pretorsion theories in the sense of A. Facchini and C. Finocchiaro, as well as examples of torsion torsion-free theories (TTF theories)."
"If A is a homotopy cartesian square of ring spectra satisfying connectivity hypotheses, then the cube induced by Goodwillie's integral cyclotomic trace from K(A) to TC(A) is homotopy cartesian. In other words, the homotopy fiber of the cyclotomic trace satisfies excision. The method of proof gives as a spin-off new proofs of some old results, as well as some new results, about periodic cyclic homology, and - more relevantly for our current application - the T-Tate spectrum of topological Hochschild homology, where T is the circle group"
"Katsura associated a $C^*$-algebra $C^*_{A,B}$ to integral matrices $A\ge 0$ and $B$ of the same size, gave sufficient conditions on $(A,B)$ making it simple purely infinite (SPI), and proved that any separable $C^*$-algebra $KK$-isomorphic to a cone of an element $\xi\in KK(C(S^1)^n,C(S^1)^n)$ in Kasparov's $KK$ is $KK$-isomorphic to an SPI $C^*_{A,B}$. Here we introduce, for the data of a commutative ring $\ell$, matrices $A,B$ as above and $C$ of the same size with coefficients in the group $\mathcal{U}(\ell)$ of invertible elements, an $\ell$-algebra $\mathcal{O}_{A,B}^C$, the twisted Katsura algebra of the triple $(A,B,C)$, show it is SPI whenever $\ell\supset\mathbb{Q}$ is a field and $(A,B)$ satisfy Katsura conditions, and that any $\ell$-algebra which is a cone of a map $\xi\in kk(\ell[t,t^{-1}]^n,\ell[t,t^{-1}]^n)$ in the bivariant algebraic $K$-theory category $kk$ is $kk$-isomorphic to an SPI $\mathcal{O}_{A,B}^C$. Twisted Katsura $\ell$-algebras are twisted Exel-Pardo algebras $L(G,E,\phi_c)$ associated to a group $G$ acting on a graph $E$, and $1$-cocycles $\phi:G\times E^1\to G$ and $c:G\times E^1\to \mathcal{U}(\ell)$. We describe $L(G,E,\phi_c)$ by generators and relations, as a quotient of a twisted semigroup algebra, as a twisted Steinberg algebra, as a corner skew Laurent polynomial algebra, and as a universal localization of a tensor algebra. We use each of these guises of $L(G,E,\phi_c)$ to study its $K$-theoretic, regularity and simplicity properties. For example we show that if $\ell\supset \mathbb{Q}$ is a field, $G$ and $E$ are countable and $E$ is regular, then $L(G,E,\phi_c)$ is simple whenever the Exel-Pardo $C^*$-algebra $C^*(G,E,\phi)$ is, and is SPI if in addition the Leavitt path algebra $L(E)$ is SPI."
"For a compact group $\mathbb{G}$, the functor from unital Banach algebras with contractive morphisms to metric spaces with 1-Lipschitz maps sending a Banach algebra $A$ to the space of $\mathbb{G}$-representations in $A$ preserves filtered colimits. Along with this, we prove a number of analogues: one can substitute unitary representations in $C^*$-algebras, as well as semisimple finite-dimensional Banach algebras (or finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras) for $\mathbb{G}$.   These all mimic results on the metric-enriched finite generation/presentability of finite-dimensional Banach spaces due to Ad{\'a}mek and Rosick{\'y}. We also give an alternative proof of that finite presentability result, along with parallel results on functors represented by compact metric, metric convex, or metric absolutely convex spaces."
"This paper explores the Tambara functor structure of the trace ideal of a Galois extension. In the case of a (pro-)cyclic extension, we are able to explicitly determine the generators of the ideal. Furthermore, we show that the absolute trace ideal of a cyclic group is strongly principal when viewed as an ideal of the Burnside Tambara Functor. Applying our results, we calculate the trace ideal for extensions of finite fields. The appendix determines a formula for the norm of a quadratic form over an arbitrary finite extension of a finite field."
"We give an overview of issues surrounding computer-verified theorem proving in the standard pure-mathematical context. This is based on my talk at the PQR conference (Brussels, June 2003)."
"In this note, we show that the category of strongly central series admits co-induced actions, which means that it is Locally Algebraically Cartesian Closed. We also show that some co-induction functors exist in the category of topological groups, and that a convenient category of topological groups is LACC."
"We use techniques from both real and complex algebraic geometry to study K-theoretic and related invariants of the algebra C(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space X. For example, we prove a parametrized version of a theorem of Joseph Gubeladze; we show that if M is a countable, abelian, cancellative, torsion-free, seminormal monoid, and X is contractible, then every finitely generated projective module over C(X)[M] is free. The particular case when M=N^n gives a parametrized version of the celebrated theorem proved independently by Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin that finitely generated projective modules over a polynomial ring over a field are free. The conjecture of Jonathan Rosenberg which predicts the homotopy invariance of the negative algebraic K-theory of C(X) follows from the particular case when M=Z^n. We also give algebraic conditions for a functor from commutative algebras to abelian groups to be homotopy invariant on C*-algebras, and for a homology theory of commutative algebras to vanish on C*-algebras. These criteria have numerous applications. For example, the vanishing criterion applied to nil-K-theory implies that commutative C*-algebras are K-regular. As another application, we show that the familiar formulas of Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg and Loday-Quillen for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of the coordinate ring of a smooth algebraic variety remain valid for the algebraic Hochschild and cyclic homology of C(X). Applications to the conjectures of Beilinson-Soule and Farrell-Jones are also given."
"Salce \cite{MR565595} introduced the notion of a \emph{cotorsion pair} of classes of abelian groups, and asked whether every such pair is \emph{complete} (i.e., has enough injectives and projectives). We prove that it is consistent, relative to the consistency of Vop\v{e}nka's Principle (VP), that the answer is affirmative. Combined with a previous result of Eklof-Shelah \cite{MR2031314}, this shows that Salce's Problem is independent of the ZFC axioms (modulo the consistency of VP)."
"Many important theorems in differential topology relate properties of manifolds to properties of their underlying homotopy types -- defined e.g. using the total singular complex or the \v{C}ech nerve of a good open cover. Upon embedding the category of manifolds into the $\infty$-topos $\mathbf{Diff}^\infty$ of differentiable sheaves one gains a further notion of underlying homotopy type: the shape of the corresponding differentiable sheaf.   In a first series of results we prove using simple cofinality and descent arguments that the shape of any manifold coincides with many other notions of underlying homotopy types such as the ones mentioned above. Our techniques moreover allow for computations, such as the homotopy type of the Haefliger stack, following Carchedi.   This leads to more refined questions, such as what it means for a mapping differential sheaf to have the correct shape. To answer these we construct model structures as well as more general homotopical calculi on the $\infty$-category $\mathbf{Diff}^\infty$ (which restrict to its full subcategory of $0$-truncated objects,$\mathbf{Diff}^\infty_{\leq 0}$) with shape equivalences as the weak equivalences. These tools are moreover developed in such a way so as to be highly customisable, with a view towards future applications, e.g. in geometric topology.   Finally, working with the $\infty$-topos $\mathbf{Diff}^0$ of sheaves on topological manifolds, we give new and conceptual proofs of some classical statements in algebraic topology. These include Dugger and Isaksen's hypercovering theorem, and the fact that the Quillen adjunction between simplicial sets and topological spaces is a Quillen equivalence."
"The goal of the present paper is to compare, in a precise way, two notions of operads up to homotopy which appear in the literature. Namely, we construct a functor from the category of strict unital homotopy colored operads to the category of infinity-operads. The former notion, that we make precise, is the operadic generalization of the notion of A-infinity-categories and the latter notion was defined by Moerdijk--Weiss in order to generalize the simplicial notion of infinity-category of Joyal--Lurie. This functor extends in two directions the simplicial nerve of Faonte--Lurie for A-infinity-categories and the homotopy coherent nerve of Moerdijk--Weiss for differential graded operads; it is also shown to be equivalent to a big nerve \`a la Lurie for differential graded operads. We prove that it satisfies some homotopy properties with respect to weak equivalences and fibrations; for instance, it is shown to be a right Quillen functor."
"We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an enhancement of a finite triangulated category. Moreover, we show that enhancements are unique when they exist, up to Morita equivalence."
"We construct a circle-invariant trace from the factorization homology of the circle $ {\sf trace} \colon \int^\alpha_{{\mathbb S}^1} \\underline{\sf End}(V) \longrightarrow \uno $ associated to a dualizable object $V\in {\boldsymbol{\mathfrak X}}$ in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. This proves a conjecture of To\""en--Vezzosi on existence of circle-invariant traces. Underlying our construction is a calculation of the factorization homology over the circle of the walking adjunction in terms of the paracyclic category of Getzler--Jones: $ \int_{{\mathbb S}^1} {\sf Adj} ~\simeq~ {\bDelta_{\circlearrowleft}}^{\triangleleft\!\triangleright} ~. $ This calculation exhibits a form of Poincar\'e duality for 1-dimensional factorization homology."
"We show that the cohomology groups usually associated with racks and quandles agree with the Quillen cohomology groups for the algebraic theories of racks and quandles, respectively. We also explain how this makes available the entire range of tools that comes with a Quillen homology theory, such as long exact sequences (transitivity) and excision isomorphisms (flat base change)."
"Bimonoidal categories are categorical analogues of rings without additive inverses. They have been actively studied in category theory, homotopy theory, and algebraic $K$-theory since around 1970. There is an abundance of new applications and questions of bimonoidal categories in mathematics and other sciences. This work provides a unified treatment of bimonoidal and higher ring-like categories, their connection with algebraic $K$-theory and homotopy theory, and applications to quantum groups and topological quantum computation. With ample background material, extensive coverage, detailed presentation of both well-known and new theorems, and a list of open questions, this work is a user friendly resource for beginners and experts alike."
"In the classical Batalin--Vilkovisky formalism, the BV operator $\Delta$ is a differential operator of order two with respect to the commutative product. In the differential graded setting, it is known that if the BV operator is homotopically trivial, then there is a tree level cohomological field theory induced on the homology; this is a manifestation of the fact that the homotopy quotient of the operad of BV algebras by $\Delta$ is represented by the operad of hypercommutative algebras. In this paper, we study generalized Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras where the operator $\Delta$ is of the given finite order. In that case, we unravel a new interesting algebraic structure on the homology whenever $\Delta$ is homotopically trivial. We also suggest that the sequence of algebraic structures arising in the higher order formalism is a part of a ""trinity"" of remarkable mathematical objects, fitting the philosophy proposed by Arnold in the 1990s."
"The filtered derived category of an abelian category has played a useful role in subjects including geometric representation theory, mixed Hodge modules, and the theory of motives. We develop a natural generalization using current methods of homotopical algebra, in the formalisms of stable infinity-categories, stable model categories, and pretriangulated, idempotent-complete dg categories. We characterize the filtered stable infinity-category Fil(C) of a stable infinity-category C as the left exact localization of sequences in C along the infinity-categorical version of completion (and prove analogous model and dg category statements). We also spell out how these constructions interact with spectral sequences and monoidal structures. As examples of this machinery, we construct a stable model category of filtered D-modules and develop the rudiments of a theory of filtered operads and filtered algebras over operads."
"We discuss several arithmetic aspects of Bianchi groups, especially from a computational point of view. In particular, we consider computing the homology of Bianchi groups together with the Hecke action, connections with automorphic forms, abelian varieties, Galois representations and the torsion in the homology of Bianchi groups. Along the way, we list several open problems and conjectures, survey the related literature, presenting concrete examples and numerical data."
We show that the following five categories are equivalent: (1) the opposite category of commutative von Neumann algebras; (2) compact strictly localizable enhanced measurable spaces; (3) measurable locales; (4) hyperstonean locales; (5) hyperstonean spaces. This result can be seen as a measure-theoretic counterpart of the Gelfand duality between commutative unital C*-algebras and compact Hausdorff topological spaces.
"The bounded localization $\beta_b$ of a locally convex topology $\beta$ is defined as the finest locally convex topology agreeing with $\beta$ on all bounded sets. We show that the strict topology on the multiplier algebra of a bornological pro-$C^*$-algebras equals its own localization, generalizing the analogous result due to Taylor for multiplier algebras of plain $C^*$-algebras.   We also (a) characterize the barreled commutative unital pro-$C^*$-algebras as those of continuous functions on functionally Hausdorff spaces whose relatively pseudocompact subsets are relatively compact, equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets, and (b) describe a contravariant equivalence between the category of commutative unital pro-$C^*$-algebras and a category of Tychonoff (rather than functionally Hausdorff) topological spaces."
"This manuscript is an extended version of the author's habilitation thesis defended on May 21, 2021 at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. It is devoted to the study of (co)stability of radicals, existence of (co)invariant Levi and Wedderburn decompositions, structure of the corresponding simple algebras and codimension growth of polynomial identities in (co)module algebras over bi- and Hopf algebras and their generalizations. The main difference between this manuscript and the ""official"" thesis are additional chapters dealing with equivalences of gradings and Hopf algebra (co)actions, V-universal (co)acting bi- and Hopf algebras and related categorical questions. (In Russian.)"
"We define and characterise small support for complexes over non-Noetherian rings and in this context prove a vanishing theorem for modules. Our definition of support makes sense for any rigidly compactly generated tensor triangulated category. Working in this generality, we establish basic properties of support and investigate when it detects vanishing. We use pointless topology to relate support, the topology of the Balmer spectrum, and the structure of the idempotent Bousfield lattice."
"In this paper, we develop the deformation theory controlled by pre-Lie algebras; the main tool is a new integration theory for pre-Lie algebras. The main field of application lies in homotopy algebra structures over a Koszul operad; in this case, we provide a homotopical description of the associated Deligne groupoid. This permits us to give a conceptual proof, with complete formulae, of the Homotopy Transfer Theorem by means of gauge action. We provide a clear explanation of this latter ubiquitous result: there are two gauge elements whose action on the original structure restrict its inputs and respectively its output to the homotopy equivalent space. This implies that a homotopy algebra structure transfers uniformly to a trivial structure on its underlying homology if and only if it is gauge trivial; this is the ultimate generalization of the $dd^c$-lemma."
"Over a field of characteristic zero, we show that two commutative differential graded (dg) algebras are quasi-isomorphic if and only if they are quasi-isomorphic as associative dg algebras. This answers a folklore problem in rational homotopy theory, showing that the rational homotopy type of a space is determined by its associative dg algebra of rational cochains. We also show a Koszul dual statement, under an additional completeness hypothesis: two homotopy complete dg Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are quasi-isomorphic as associative dg algebras must themselves be quasi-isomorphic. The latter result applies in particular to nilpotent Lie algebras (not differential graded), in which case it says that two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as associative algebras must be isomorphic."
"The main purpose of this paper is to provide explicit computations of the fundamental group of several algebras. For this purpose, given a $k$-algebra $A$, we consider the category of all connected gradings of $A$ by a group $G$ and we study the relation between gradings and Galois coverings. This theoretical tool gives information about the fundamental group of $A$, which allows its computation using complete lists of gradings."
"This text is based on lectures given by authors in summer 2015. It contains an introduction to the theory of limits over the category of presentations, with examples of different well-known functors like homology or derived functors of non-additive functors in a form of derived limits. The theory of so-called ${\bf fr}$-codes also is developed. This is a method how different functors from the category of groups to the category of abelian groups, such as group homology, tensor products of abelianization, can be coded as sentences in the alphabet with two symbols ${\bf f}$ and ${\bf r}$."
"Let p be an odd prime number. We describe the Whitehead group of all extra-special and almost extra-special p-groups. For this we compute, for any finite p-group P , the subgroup Cl\_1 (ZP) of SK\_1 (ZP), in terms of a genetic basis of P. We also introduce a deflation map Cl\_1 (ZP) $\rightarrow$ Cl\_1 (Z(P/N)) , for a normal subgroup N of P , and show that it is always surjective. Along the way, we give a new proof of the result describing the structure of SK\_1 (ZP), when P is an elementary abelian p-group."
"Let p be an odd prime number. In this paper, we show that the genome $\Gamma(P)$ of a finite $p$-group $P$, defined as the direct product of the genotypes of all rational irreducible representations of $P$, can be recovered from the first group of $K$-theory $K_1(\mathbb{Q}P)$. It follows that the assignment $P \to \Gamma(P)$ is a $p$-biset functor. We give an explicit formula for the action of bisets on $\Gamma$, in terms of generalized transfers associated to left free bisets. Finally, we show that $\Gamma$ is a rational $p$-biset functor, i.e. that $\Gamma$ factors through the Roquette category of finite $p$-groups."
"This research notes is intended to provide a quick introduction to the subject. We expose a K-theoretic approach to study group C*-algebras: started in the elementary part, with one example of description of the structure of C*-algebras of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line, continued then for special classes of solvable and nilpotent Lie groups. In the second advanced part, we introduced the main tools of the theory. In particular, the conception of multidimensional geometric quantization and the index of group C*-algebras were created and developed."
"In a survey paper in 2011, Amiot proposed a conjectural characterisation of the cluster categories which were conceived in the mid 2000s to lift the combinatorics of Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras to the categorical level. This paper is devoted to a proof of (a variant of) her conjecture. More generally, cluster categories admit higher dimensional and relative variants, the so-called Higgs categories recently introduced by Wu. We also prove higher-dimensional and relative variants of the conjecture."
This book contains the material of my research on stereotype duality theories in geometry. It was intended as a continuation of my recently published monograph in De Gruyter on stereotype spaces and algebras.
"We show that the additive category of chain complexes parametrized by a finite simplicial complex $K$ forms a category with chain duality. This fact, never fully proven in the original reference, is fundamental for Ranicki's algebraic formulation of the surgery exact sequence of Sullivan and Wall, and his interpretation of the surgery obstruction map as the passage from local Poincar\'e duality to global Poincar\'e duality. Our paper also gives a new, conceptual, and geometric treatment of chain duality on $K$-based chain complexes."
"Cobordism groups and cut-and-paste groups of manifolds arise from imposing two different relations on the monoid of manifolds under disjoint union. By imposing both relations simultaneously, a cobordism cut and paste group $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}_n$ is defined. In this paper, we extend this definition to manifolds with boundary obtaining $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$ and study the relationship of this group to an appropriately defined cobordism group of manifolds with boundary. The main results are the construction of a spectrum that recovers on $\pi_0$ the cobordism cut and paste groups of manifolds with boundary, $\overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$, and a map of spectra that lifts the canonical quotient map $\mathrm{SK}^{\partial}_n \rightarrow \overline{\mathrm{SK}}^{\partial}_n$."
"In this paper we elaborate a general homotopy-theoretic framework in which to study problems of descent and completion and of their duals, codescent and cocompletion. Our approach to homotopic (co)descent and to derived (co)completion can be viewed as $\infty$-category-theoretic, as our framework is constructed in the universe of simplicially enriched categories, which are a model for $(\infty, 1)$-categories.   We provide general criteria, reminiscent of Mandell's theorem on $E_{\infty}$-algebra models of $p$-complete spaces, under which homotopic (co)descent is satisfied. Furthermore, we construct general descent and codescent spectral sequences, which we interpret in terms of derived (co)completion and homotopic (co)descent.   We show that a number of very well-known spectral sequences, such as the unstable and stable Adams spectral sequences, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and the descent spectral sequence of a map, are examples of general (co)descent spectral sequences. There is also a close relationship between the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture and homotopic descent along the Dwyer-Friedlander map from algebraic K-theory to \'etale K-theory. Moreover, there are intriguing analogies between derived cocompletion (respectively, completion) and homotopy left (respectively, right) Kan extensions and their associated assembly (respectively, coassembly) maps."
"We combine aspects of the notions of finite decomposition complexity and asymptotic property C into a notion that we call finite APC-decomposition complexity. Any space with finite decomposition complexity has finite APC-decomposition complexity and any space with asymptotic property C has finite APC-decomposition complexity. Moreover, finite APC-decomposition complexity implies property A for metric spaces. We also show that finite APC-decomposition complexity is preserved by direct products of groups and spaces, amalgamated products of groups, and group extensions, among other constructions."
"We introduce concepts of intermediate rank for countable groups that ""interpolate"" between consecutive values of the classical (integer-valued) rank. Various classes of groups are proved to have intermediate rank behaviors. We are especially interested in interpolation between rank 1 and rank 2. For instance, we construct groups ""of rank 7/4"". Our setting is essentially that of non positively curved spaces, where concepts of intermediate rank include polynomial rank, local rank, and mesoscopic rank. The resulting framework has interesting connections to operator algebras. We prove property RD in many cases where intermediate rank occurs. This gives a new family of groups satisfying the Baum-Connes conjecture. We prove that the reduced $C^*$-algebras of groups of rank 7/4 have stable rank 1."
"If $H$ is a lattice in a locally compact second countable group $G$, then we show that $G$ has property A (respectively is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space) if and only if $H$ has property A (respectively is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space). Moreover, we show three interesting generalizations of this result. If $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ that is co-amenable in $G$, and if $H$ has property A (respectively, is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space), then we show that $G$ has property A (respectively, is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space). We also show that an extension of property A groups still has property A. On the coarse embeddability side, we show that if $\{e\}\rightarrow H\rightarrow G\rightarrow Q\rightarrow\{e\}$ is a short exact sequence, and if either $H$ is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space and $Q$ has property A, or $H$ is compact and $Q$ is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space, then $G$ is coarsely embeddable into Hilbert space. We extend the theory of measure equivalence to locally compact non-unimodular groups. In a natural way, we can also define measure equivalence subgroups. We show that property A and uniform embeddability into Hilbert space pass to measure equivalence subgroups. Using the same techniques, we show that also the Haagerup property, weak amenability and the weak Haagerup property pass to measure equivalence subgroups."
"The notions of a {\em 2-precontact space}\/ and a {\em 2-contact space}\/ are introduced. Using them, new representation theorems for precontact and contact algebras are proved. It is shown that there are bijective correspondences between such kinds of algebras and such kinds of spaces. As applications of the obtained results, we get new connected versions of the Stone Duality Theorems for Boolean algebras and for complete Boolean algebras, as well as a Smirnov-type theorem for a kind of compact $T_0$-extensions of compact Hausdorff extremally disconnected spaces. We also introduce the notion of a {\em Stone adjacency space}\/ and using it, we prove another representation theorem for precontact algebras. We even obtain a bijective correspondence between the class of all, up to isomorphism, precontact algebras and the class of all, up to isomorphism, Stone adjacency spaces."
"Using representation theory, we compute the spectrum of the Dirac operator on the universal covering group of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$, exhibiting it as the generator of $KK^1(\mathbb C, \mathfrak A)$, where $\mathfrak A$ is the reduced $C^*$-algebra of the group. This yields a new and direct computation of the $K$-theory of $\mathfrak A$. A fundamental role is played by the limit-of-discrete-series representation, which is the frontier between the discrete and the principal series of the group. We provide a detailed analysis of the localised spectra of the Dirac operator and compute the Dirac cohomology."
"Inspired by work of Szymik and Wahl on the homology of Higman-Thompson groups, we establish a general connection between ample groupoids, topological full groups, algebraic K-theory spectra and infinite loop spaces, based on the construction of small permutative categories of compact open bisections. This allows us to analyse homological invariants of topological full groups in terms of homology for ample groupoids.   Applications include complete rational computations, general vanishing and acyclicity results for group homology of topological full groups as well as a proof of Matui's AH-conjecture for all minimal, ample groupoids with comparison."
"This paper introduces two new Burnside rings for a finite group $G$, called the slice Burnside ring and the section Burnside ring. They are built as Grothendieck rings of the category of morphisms of $G$-sets, and of Galois morphisms of $G$-sets, respectively. The well known results on the usual Burnside ring, concerning ghost maps, primitive idempotents, and description of the prime spectrum, are extended to these rings. It is also shown that these two rings have a natural structure of Green biset functor. The functorial structure of unit groups of these rings is also discussed."
"We define the optimal constant $Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; G )$ of Young's convolution inequality as \begin{align}   Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; G ) := \sup \{ \| \phi_1 * ( \phi_2 \Delta^{1 / p_1'} ) \|_p \mid \phi_1 , \phi_2 \colon G \to \mathbb{C} , \; \| \phi_1 \|_{p_1} = \| \phi_2 \|_{p_2} = 1 \} \end{align} for a locally compact group $G$ and $1 \leq p_1 , p_2 , p \leq \infty$ with $1 / p_1 + 1 / p_2 = 1 + 1 / p$. Here $p'$ is the H\""{o}lder conjugate of $p$, $\| \cdot \|_{ p }$ is the $L^p$-norm on a left Haar measure, and $\Delta \colon G \to \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ is the modular function. The main result of this paper is that $Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; G ) \leq Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; H )$ for any closed subgroup $H \subset G$. It follows from this inequality that $Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; G ) \leq Y ( p_1 , p_2 ; \mathbb{R} )^{ \dim G - r ( G ) }$ for any connected Lie group $G$ such that the center of the semisimple part is a finite group such as connected linear Lie groups and connected solvable Lie groups, where $r ( G )$ is the dimension of the maximal compact subgroups of $G$."
"A subset of a Polish space $X$ is called universally small if it belongs to each ccc $\sigma$-ideal with Borel base on $X$. Under CH in each uncountable Abelian Polish group $G$ we construct a universally small subset $A_0\subset G$ such that $|A_0\cap gA_0|=\mathfrak c$ for each $g\in G$. For each cardinal number $\kappa\in[5,\mathfrak c^+]$ the set $A_0$ contains a universally small subset $A$ of $G$ with sharp packing index $\pack^\sharp(A_\kappa)=\sup\{|\mathcal D|^+:\mathcal D\subset \{gA\}_{g\in G}$ is disjoint$\}$ equal to $\kappa$."
The topological significance of the spectral Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta-invariant is investigated under the parity conditions of P. Gilkey. We show that twice the fractional part of the invariant is computed by the linking pairing in K-theory with the orientation bundle of the manifold. The Pontrjagin duality implies the nondegeneracy of the linking form. An example of a nontrivial fractional part for an even-order operator is presented. This result answers the question of P. Gilkey (1989) concerning the existence of even-order operators on odd-dimensional manifolds with nontrivial fractional part of eta-invariant.
"We develop a general theory which enables the computation of the Picard group of a symmetric monoidal triangulated category, equipped with a weight structure, in terms of the Picard group of the associated heart. As an application, we compute the Picard group of several categories of motivic nature - mixed Artin motives, mixed Artin-Tate motives, motivic spectra, noncommutative mixed Artin motives, noncommutative mixed motives of central simple algebras, noncommutative mixed motives of separable algebras - as well as the Picard group of the derived categories of symmetric ring spectra."
"We furnish any category of a universal (co)homology theory. Universal (co)homologies and universal relative (co)homologies are obtained by showing representability of certain functors and take values in $R$-linear abelian categories of motivic nature, where $R$ is any commutative unitary ring. Universal homology theory on the one point category yields ""hieratic"" $R$-modules, i.e. the indization of Freyd's free abelian category on $R$. Grothendieck $\partial$-functors and satellite functors are recovered as certain additive relative homologies on an abelian category for which we also show the existence of universal ones."
"We develop a theory of enriched categories over a (higher) category M equipped with a class W of morphisms called homotopy equivalences. We call them Segal M_W -categories. Our motivation was to generalize the notion of ""up-to-homotopy monoids"" in a monoidal category M, introduced by Leinster. The formalism adopted generalizes the classical Segal categories and extends the theory of enriched category over a bicategory. In particular we have a linear version of Segal categories which did not exist so far. Our goal in this paper is to present the theory and provide some examples. Applications are reserved for the future."
"We clarify the relationship between Grothendieck duality \`a la Neeman and the Wirthm\""uller isomorphism \`a la Fausk-Hu-May. We exhibit an interesting pattern of symmetry in the existence of adjoint functors between compactly generated tensor-triangulated categories, which leads to a surprising trichotomy: There exist either exactly three adjoints, exactly five, or infinitely many. We highlight the importance of so-called relative dualizing objects and explain how they give rise to dualities on canonical subcategories. This yields a duality theory rich enough to capture the main features of Grothendieck duality in algebraic geometry, of generalized Pontryagin-Matlis duality \`a la Dwyer-Greenlees-Iyengar in the theory of ring spectra, and of Brown-Comenetz duality \`a la Neeman in stable homotopy theory."
We prove a stronger version of the octahedral axiom in a pre-triangulated category. The proof uses a new lemma about exact sequences in pointed additive categories which is based on a weak converse of the snake lemma.
"We propose a categorification of the Chern character that refines earlier work of To\""en and Vezzosi and of Ganter and Kapranov. If X is an algebraic stack, our categorified Chern character is a symmetric monoidal functor from a category of mixed noncommutative motives over X, which we introduce, to S1-equivariant perfect complexes on the derived free loop stack LX. As an application of the theory, we show that To\""en and Vezzosi's secondary Chern character factors through secondary K-theory. Our techniques depend on a careful investigation of the functoriality of traces in symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-categories, which is of independent interest."
"A triangulation of a punctured or pinched surface is irreducible if no edge can be shrunk without producing multiple edges or changing the topological type of the surface. The finiteness of the set of (non-isomorphic) irreducible triangulations of any punctured surface is established. Complete lists of irreducible triangulations are determined for the M\""obius band (6 in number) and the pinched torus (2 in number). All the non-isomorphic combinatorial types (20 in number) of triangulations of the projective plane with up to 8 vertices are determined."
"In an earlier paper, we described bordered algebras for knot Floer homology. In this paper, we introduce a differential graded algebra, the pong algebra and compute the A-infinity structure on its homology."
"We compute the stable homology of orthogonal and symplectic groups over a finite field k with coefficients coming from an usual endofunctor F of k-vector spaces (exterior, symmetric, divided powers...), that is, for all natural integer i, we compute the colimits of the vector spaces $H_i(O_{n,n}(k) ; F(k^{2n}))$ and $H_i(Sp_{2n}(k) ; F(k^{2n}))$. In this situation, the stabilization is a classical result of Charney. We give a formal framework to connect stable homology of some families of groups and homology of suitable small categories thanks to a spectral sequence which collapses in several cases. By our purely algebraic methods (i.e. without stable K-theory) we obtain again results of Betley for stable homology of linear groups and symmetric groups. For orthogonal and symplectic groups over a field we prove a categorical result for vector spaces equipped with quadratic or alternating forms and use powerful cancellation results known in homology of functors (Suslin, Scorichenko, Djament) to deduce a spectacular simplification of the second sheet of our general spectral sequence. When we consider the orthogonal and symplectic groups over a finite field and we take coefficients with values in vector spaces over the same field, we can compute the second sheet of the spectral sequence thanks to classical results: homological cancellation with trivial coefficients (Quillen, Fiedorowicz-Priddy) and calculation of torsion groups between usual functors (Franjou-Friedlander-Scorichenko-Suslin, Chalupnik)."
"We compute coherent presentations of Artin monoids, that is presentations by generators, relations, and relations between the relations. For that, we use methods of higher-dimensional rewriting that extend Squier's and Knuth-Bendix's completions into a homotopical completion-reduction, applied to Artin's and Garside's presentations. The main result of the paper states that the so-called Tits-Zamolodchikov 3-cells extend Artin's presentation into a coherent presentation. As a byproduct, we give a new constructive proof of a theorem of Deligne on the actions of an Artin monoid on a category."
In his thesis B. Keller solved the universal problem of the extension of an exact category to its (bounded) derived category by introducing the notions of tower of exact and triangulated categories and proving the universal property in this setting. In this note we show that his result extends to the corresponding universal problem for Grothendieck's derivators.
"We study 2-representations, i.e., actions of 2-groups on 2-vector spaces. Our main focus is character theory for 2-representations. To this end we employ the technique of extended Burnside rings. Our main theorem is that the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character is a particular mark homomorphism of the Burnside ring. As an application we give a new proof of Osorno formula for the Ganter-Kapranov 2-character of a finite group."
"We give a new categorical way to construct the central stability homology of Putman and Sam and explain how it can be used in the context of representation stability and homological stability. In contrast to them, we cover categories with infinite automorphism groups. We also connect central stability homology to Randal-Williams and Wahl's work on homological stability. We also develop a criterion that implies that functors that are polynomial in the sense of Randal-Williams and Wahl are centrally stable in the sense of Putman."
"Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a weakly idempotent complete exact category with enough injective and projective objects. Assume that $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{E}$ is a rigid, contravariantly finite subcategory of $\mathcal{E}$ containing all the injective and projective objects, and stable under taking direct sums and summands. In this paper, $\mathcal{E}$ is equipped with the structure of a prefibration category with cofibrant replacements. As a corollary, we show, using the results of Demonet and Liu in \cite{DL}, that the category of finite presentation modules on the costable category $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ is a localization of $\mathcal{E}$. We also deduce that $\mathcal{E} \to \mathrm{mod}\overline{\mathcal{M}}$ admits a calculus of fractions up to homotopy. These two corollaries are analogues for exact categories of results of Buan and Marsh in \cite{BM2}, \cite{BM1} (see also \cite{Be}) that hold for triangulated categories.   If $\mathcal{E}$ is a Frobenius exact category, we enhance its structure of prefibration category to the structure of a model category (see the article of Palu in \cite{Palu} for the case of triangulated categories). This last result applies in particular when $\mathcal{E}$ is any of the Hom-finite Frobenius categories appearing in relation to cluster algebras."
"We study collections of additive categories $\mathcal{M}(G)$, indexed by finite groups $G$ and related by induction and restriction in a way that categorifies usual Mackey functors. We call them `Mackey 2-functors'. We provide a large collection of examples in particular thanks to additive derivators. We prove the first properties of Mackey 2-functors, including separable monadicity of restriction to subgroups. We then isolate the initial such structure, leading to what we call `Mackey 2-motives'. We also exhibit a convenient calculus of morphisms in Mackey 2-motives, by means of string diagrams. Finally, we show that the 2-endomorphism ring of the identity of $G$ in this 2-category of Mackey 2-motives is isomorphic to the so-called crossed Burnside ring of $G$."
"We study ""canonical weight decompositions"" slightly generalizing that defined by J. Wildeshaus. For an triangulated category $C$, any integer $n$, and a weight structure $w$ on $C$ a triangle $LM\to M\to RM\to LM[1]$, where $LM$ is of weights at most $m-1$ and $RM$ is of weights at least $n+1$ for some $m\le n$, is determined by $M$ if exists. This happens if and only if the weight complex $t(M)\in Obj K(Hw)$ ($Hw$ is the heart of $w$) is homotopy equivalent to a complex with zero terms in degrees $-n,\dots, -m$; hence this condition can be ""detected"" via pure functors. One can also take $m=-\infty$ or $n=+\infty$ to obtain that the weight complex functor is ""conservative and detects weights up to objects of infinitely small and infinitely large weights""; this is a significant improvement over previously known bounded conservativity results. Applying this statement we ""calculate intersections of purely generated subcategories"" and prove that certain weight-exact functors are conservative up to weight-degenerate objects. The main tool is the new interesting notion of morphisms killing weights $m,\dots, n$ that we study in detail as well.   We apply general results to equivariant stable homotopy categories and spherical weight structures for them (as introduced in the previous paper) and obtain a certain converse to the (equivariant) stable Hurewicz theorem. In particular, the singular homology of a spectrum $E$ vanishes in negative degrees if and only if $E$ is an extension of a connective spectrum by an acyclic one."
"Coherent strings of composable morphisms play an important role in various important constructions in abstract stable homotopy theory (for example algebraic K-theory or higher Toda brackets) and in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras (as representations of Dynkin quivers of type A). In a first step we will prove a strong comparison result relating composable strings of morphisms and coherent diagrams on cubes with support on a path from the initial to the final object.   We observe that both structures are equivalent (by passing to higher analogues of mesh categories) to distinguished coherent diagrams on special classes of morphism objects in the 2-category of parasimplices. Furthermore, we show that the notion of distinguished coherent diagrams generalizes well to arbitrary morphism objects in this 2-category. The resulting categories of coherent diagrams lead to higher versions of the $\mathsf{S}_{\bullet}$-construction and are closely related to representations of higher Auslander algebras of Dynkin quivers of type A.   Understanding these categories and the functors relating them in general will require a detailed analysis of the 2-category of parasimplices as well as basic results from abstract cubical homotopy theory (since subcubes of distinguished diagrams very often turn out to be bicartesian). Finally, we show that the previous comparison result extends to a duality theorem on general categories of distinguished coherent diagrams, as a special case leading to some new derived equivalences between higher Auslander algebras."
"In this paper, we construct and study derived character maps of finite-dimensional representations of $\infty$-groups. As models for $\infty$-groups we take homotopy simplicial groups, i.e. homotopy simplicial algebras over the algebraic theory of groups (in the sense of Badzioch). We define cyclic, symmetric and representation homology for `group algebras' over such groups and construct canonical trace maps relating these homology theories. In the case of one-dimensional representations, we show that our trace maps are of topological origin: they are induced by natural maps of (iterated) loop spaces that are well studied in homotopy theory. Using this topological interpretation, we deduce some algebraic results about representation homology: in particular, we prove that the symmetric homology of group algebras and one-dimensional representation homology are naturally isomorphic, provided the base ring $k$ is a field of characteristic zero. We also study the behavior of the derived character maps of $n$-dimensional representations in the stable limit as $ n\to \infty$, in which case we show that they `converge' to become isomorphisms."
"By an automorphism of a topological group G we mean an isomorphism of G onto itself which is also a homeomorphism. In this article, we study the automorphism group Aut(G) of a dense subgroup G of R^n, n>=1. We show that Aut(G) can be naturally identified with the subgroup I(G)={A in GL(n,R): G A =G} of the group GL(n,R) of all non-degenerated (n x n)-matrices over R, where G A={g A:g in G}. We describe $I(G) for many dense subgroups G of either R or R^2. We consider also an inverse problem of which symmetric subgroups of GL(n,R) can be realized as I(G) for some dense subgroup G of R^n. For example, for n>=2, we show that the group {A in GL(n,R): det A=+-1} cannot be realized in this way. The realization problem is quite non-trivial even in the one-dimensional case and has deep connections to number theory."
"The aim of this paper is to develop a new axiomatization of planar geometry by reinterpreting the original axioms of Euclid. The basic concept is still that of a line segment but its equivalent notion of betweenness is viewed as a topological, not a metric concept. That leads quickly to the notion of connectedness without any need to dwell on the definition of topology. In our approach line segments must be connected. Lines and planes are unified via the concept of separation: lines are separated into two components by each point, planes contain lines that separate them into two components as well. We add a subgroup of bijections preserving line segments and establishing unique isomorphism of basic geometrical sets, and the axiomatic structure is complete. Of fundamental importance is the Fixed Point Theorem that allows for creation of the concepts of length and congruency of line segments. The resulting structure is much more in sync with modern science than other axiomatic approaches to planar geometry. For instance, it leads naturally to the Erlangen Program in geometry. Our Conditions of Homogeneity and Rigidity have two interpretations. In physics, they correspond to the basic tenet that independent observers should arrive at the same measurement and are related to boosts in special relativity. In geometry, they mean uniqueness of congruence for certain geometrical figures.   Another thread of the paper is the introduction of boundary at infinity, an important concept of modern mathematics, and linking of Pasch Axiom to endowing boundaries at infinity with a natural relation of betweenness. That way spherical geometry can be viewed as geometry of boundaries at infinity."
"We work within the framework of a program aimed at exploring various extended versions for theorems from a class containing Borsuk-Ulam type theorems, some fixed point theorems, the KKM lemma, Radon, Tverberg, and Helly theorems. In this paper we study variations of the Hopf theorem concerning continuous maps of a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We investigate the case of maps $f\colon M \to \mathbb{R}^m$ with $n < m$ and introduce several notions of varied types of $f$-neighbors, which is a pair of distinct points in $M$ such that $f$ takes it to a 'small' set of some type. Next for each type, we ask what distances on $M$ are realized as distances between $f$-neighbors of this type and study various characteristics of this set of distances. One of our main results is as follows. Let $f\colon M \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a continuous map. We say that two distinct points $a$ and $b$ in $M$ are visual $f$-neighbors if the segment in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ with endpoints $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ intersects $f(M)$ only at $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then the set of distances that are realized as distances between visual $f$-neighbors is infinite. Besides we generalize the Hopf theorem in a quantitative sense."
"We introduce the concept of Roe C*-algebra for a locally compact groupoid whose unit space is in general not compact, and that is equipped with an appropriate coarse structure and Haar system. Using Connes' tangent groupoid method, we introduce an analytic index for an elliptic differential operator on a Lie groupoid equipped with additional metric structure, which takes values in the K-theory of the Roe C*-algebra. We apply our theory to derive a Lichnerowicz type vanishing result for foliations on open manifolds."
"We describe a general correspondence between injective (resp. projective) recollements of triangulated categories and injective (resp. projective) cotorsion pairs. This provides a model category description of these recollement situations. Our applications focus on displaying several recollements that glue together various full subcategories of K(R), the homotopy category of chain complexes of modules over a general ring R. When R is (left) Noetherian ring, these recollements involve complexes built from the Gorenstein injective modules. When R is a (left) coherent ring for which all flat modules have finite projective dimension we obtain the duals. These results extend to a general ring R by replacing the Gorenstein modules with the Gorenstein AC-modules introduced recently in the work of Bravo-Gillespie-Hovey. We also see that in any abelian category with enough injectives, the Gorenstein injective objects enjoy a maximality property in that they contain every other class making up the right half of an injective cotorsion pair."
"For a localization of a smooth proper category, we show that morphisms in Efimov's algebraizable categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity can be computed using the natural cone between right and left adjoints of the localization functor. In particular, this recovers the following result of Ganatra--Gao--Venkatesh: morphisms in categorical formal punctured neighborhoods of wrapped Fukaya categories are computed by Rabinowitz wrapping."
"We translate Akin's notion of {\it good} (and related concepts) from measures on Cantor sets to traces on dimension groups, and particularly for invariant measures of minimal homeomorphisms (and their corresponding simple dimension groups), this yields characterizations and examples, which translate back to the original context. Good traces on a simple dimension group are characterized by their kernel having dense image in their annihilating set of affine functions on the trace space; this makes it possible to construct many examples with seemingly paradoxical properties. In order to study the related property of {\it refinability,} we consider goodness for sets of measures (traces on dimension groups), and obtain partial characterizations in terms of (special) convex subsets of Choquet simplices. These notions also very closely related to unperforation of quotients of dimension groups by convex subgroups (that are not order ideals), and we give partial characterizations. Numerous examples illustrate the results."
"This paper is to construct unstable, Morita stable and stable bivariant algebraic Kasparov $K$-theory spectra of $k$-algebras. These are shown to be homotopy invariant, excisive in each variable $K$-theories. We prove that the spectra represent universal unstable, Morita stable and stable bivariant homology theories respectively."
"We give a complex polarized variation of Hodge structure over a compact K""ahler manifold $M$ which controls all finite-dimensional complex polarized variations of Hodge structure over $M$ and their tensor relations. As a corollary, we obtain the cohomology algebra with values in a local system admitting multiplicative Hodge structures."
"For a completely Hausdorff quasi-topological group $G$, we construct a universal pro-$C^*$-algebra $C(E^+G)$ as the non-commutative geometer's analogue of the total space $EG$ of the classifying principal $G$-bundle $EG\to BG$. The pro-$C^*$-algebra $C(EG)$ of (possibly unbounded) continuous functions on $EG$ is then recoverable as the abelianization of $C(E^+G)$. Along the way, we develop various aspects of the theory of quasi-topological $G$-spaces and $G$-pro-$C^*$-algebras."
"We derive a family of prime ideals of the Burnside Tambara functor for a finite group $G$. In the case of cyclic groups, this family comprises the entire prime spectrum. We include some partial results towards the same result for a larger class of groups."
"Consider the obvious functor from the unbounded derived category of all finitely generated modules over a left noetherian ring $R$ to the unbounded derived category of all modules. We answer the natural question whether this functor defines an equivalence onto the full subcategory of complexes with finitely generated cohomology modules in two special cases. If $R$ is a quasi-Frobenius ring of infinite global dimension, then this functor is not full. If $R$ has finite left global dimension, this functor is an equivalence. We also prove variants of the latter assertion for left coherent rings, for noetherian schemes and for locally noetherian Grothendieck categories."
Let $R$ be a ring and $T$ be a good Wakamatsu-tilting module with $S$ the endomorphism ring. We prove that $T$ induces an equivalence between stable categories of repetitive algebras of $R$ and $S$.
"In this paper, we use geometric tools to study the structure of asymptotic expanders and show that a sequence of asymptotic expanders always admits a ""uniform exhaustion by expanders"". It follows that asymptotic expanders cannot be coarsely embedded into any $L^p$-space, and that asymptotic expanders can be characterised in terms of their uniform Roe algebra. Moreover, we provide uncountably many new counterexamples to the coarse Baum--Connes conjecture. These appear to be the first counterexamples that are not directly constructed by means of spectral gaps. Finally, we show that vertex-transitive asymptotic expanders are actually expanders. In particular, this gives a $C^*$-algebraic characterisation of expanders for vertex-transitive graphs."
"Given a map $f: X\rightarrow Y$ of simply connected spaces of finite type such. The space of based loops at $f$ of the space of maps between $X$ and $Y$ is denoted by $\Omega_{f} Map(X,Y)$. For $n> 0$, we give a model categorical interpretation of the existence (in functorial way) of an injective map of $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces $\pi_{n} \Omega_{f}Map(X,Y_{\mathbb{Q}}) \rightarrow HH^{-n}(C^{\ast}(Y),C^{\ast}(X)_{f})$, where $HH^{\ast}$ is the (negative) Hochschild cohomology and $C^{\ast}(X)_{f}$ is the rational cochain complex associated to $X$ equipped with a structure of $C^{\ast}(Y)$-differential graded bimodule via the induced map of differential graded algebras $f^{\ast}: C^{\ast}(Y)\rightarrow C^{\ast}(X)$. Moreover, we identifiy the image in presice way by using the Hodge filtration on Hochschild cohomology. In particular, when $X=Y$, we describe the fundamental group of the identity component of the monoid of self equivalence of a (rationalization of) space $X$ i.e., $\pi_{1} Aut(X_{\mathbb{Q}})_{id}$."
"In 'Hochschild (co)homology of exterior algebras' (Han, Xu, 2007), the authors computed the additive and multiplicative structure of $H\!H^\ast\!(A;\!A)$, where $A$ is the $n$-th exterior algebra over a field. In this paper, we derive all their results using a different method (AMT), as well as calculate the additive structure of $H\!H_k\!(A;\!A)$ and $H\!H^k\!(A;\!A)$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. We provide concise presentations of algebras $H\!H_\ast\!(A;\!A)$ and $H\!H^\ast\!(A;\!A)$, as well as determine their generators in the Hochschild complex. Lastly, we compute an explicit free resolution (spanned by multisets) of the $A^e$-module $A$ and describe the homotopy equivalence to its bar resolution."
"Let $R$ be a strongly $\mathbb{Z}^2$-graded ring, and let $C$ be a bounded chain complex of finitely generated free $R$-modules. The complex $C$ is $R_{(0,0)}$-finitely dominated, or of type FP over $R_{(0,0)}$, if it is chain homotopy equivalent to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective $R_{(0,0)}$-modules. We show that this happens if and only if $C$ becomes acyclic after taking tensor product with a certain eight rings of formal power series, the graded analogues of classical Novikov rings. This extends results of Ranicki, Quinn and the first author on Laurent polynomial rings in one and two indeterminates."
"This paper studies the interaction of $\pi_1(M)$ for a $C^\infty$ manifold $M$ with Bott's original obstruction to integrability, and with differential geometric invariants such as Godbillon-Vey and Cheeger-Simons invariants of a foliation. We prove that the ring of higher Pontrjagin and higher Chern classes of an integrable subbundle $E$ of the tangent bundle of a manifold vanishes above dimension $2k$ where $k=dim(TM/E)$, and where the higher Pontrjagin and Chern rings are rings generated by $i^*y \cup p_j(TM/E)$ and by $i^*y \cup c_j(TM/E)$ respectively, with $p_j$ the $j$-th Pontrjagin class, $c_j$ the $j$-th Chern class, $i:M \to B\pi$ and $\pi=\pi_1(BG)$, where $BG$ is the classifying space of the holonomy groupoid corresponding to $E$ and $y \in H^*(B\pi)$, provided that the fundamental group of $BG$ satisfies the Novikov conjecture. In addition, we show the vanishing of higher Pontrjagin and Chern rings generated by $i^*x \cup p_j(TM/E)$, and by $i^*x \cup c_j(TM/E)$ as before but with $i:M \to BG$, $BG$ as above and $x \in H^*(BG)$ provided $(M,\mathcal{F})$ satisfied the foliated Novikov conjecture, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the foliation whose tangent bundle is $E$. We give examples of this obstruction and of higher Godbillon-Vey and Cheeger-Simons invariants."
"We give a detailed account of various connections between several classes of objects: Hankel, Hurwitz, Toeplitz, Vandermonde and other structured matrices, Stietjes and Jacobi-type continued fractions, Cauchy indices, moment problems, total positivity, and root localization of univariate polynomials. Along with a survey of many classical facts, we provide a number of new results."
We present a new and explicit method for lifting a tilting complex to a bimodule complex. The key ingredient of our method is the notion of a strong homotopy action in the sense of Stasheff.
"We provide an intrinsic definition of the fundamental group of a linear category over a ring as the automorphism group of the fibre functor on Galois coverings. If the universal covering exists, we prove that this group is isomorphic to the Galois group of the universal covering. The grading deduced from a Galois covering enables us to describe the canonical monomorphism from its automorphism group to the first Hochschild-Mitchell cohomology vector space."
"We study abelian localizations of triangulated categories induced by rigid contravariantly finite subcategories, and also triangulated structures on subfactor categories of triangulated categories. In this context we generalize recent results of Buan-Marsh and Iyama-Yoshino. We also extend basic results of Keller-Reiten concerning the Gorenstein and the Calabi-Yau property for categories arising from certain rigid, not necessarily cluster tilting, subcategories, as well as several results of the literature concerning the connections between 2-cluster tilting subcategories of triangulated categories and tilting subcategories of the associated abelian category of coherent functors. Finally we characterize 2-cluster tilting subcategories along these lines."
"We study Artin algebras $A$ and commutative Noetherian complete local rings $R$ in connection with the following decomposition property of Gorenstein-projective modules: $(*)$ any Gorenstein-projective module is a direct sum of finitely generated modules. We show that this direct decomposition property is related to the property of the algebra $A$, or the ring $R$, being (virtually) Gorenstein of finite Cohen-Macaquly type. Along the way we generalize classical results of Auslander and Ringel-Tachikawa from the early seventies, and results of Chen and Yoshino on the structure of Gorenstein-projective modules. Finally we study homological properties of (stable) relative Auslander algebras of virtually Gorenstein algebras of finite Cohen-Macaulay type and, under the presence of a cluster-tilting object, we give descriptions of the stable category of Gorenstein-projective modules in terms of suitable cluster categories."
"In this monograph, we extend S. Schwede's exact sequence interpretation of the Gerstenhaber bracket in Hochschild cohomology to certain exact and monoidal categories. Therefore we establish an explicit description of an isomorphism by A. Neeman and V. Retakh, which links $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups with fundamental groups of categories of extensions and relies on expressing the fundamental group of a (small) category by means of the associated Quillen groupoid.   As a main result, we show that our construction behaves well with respect to structure preserving functors between exact monoidal categories. We use our main result to conclude, that both the Lie bracket and the squaring map in Hochschild cohomology are invariants under Morita equivalence. For quasi-triangular bialgebras, we further determine a significant part of the Lie bracket's kernel, and thereby prove a conjecture by L. Menichi. Along the way, we introduce $n$-extension closed and entirely extension closed subcategories of abelian categories, and study some of their properties."
"We generalize the notion of stable equivalence of Morita type and define what is called ""singular equivalence of Morita type with level"". Such an equivalence of induces an equivalence between singular categories. We will also prove that a derived equivalence of standard type induces a singular equivalence of Morita type with level."
"In this paper, we define the singular Hochschild cohomology groups $HH_{sg}^i(A, A)$ of an associative $k$-algebra $A$ as morphisms from $A$ to $A[i]$ in the singular category $D_{sg}(A\otimes_k A^{op})$ for $i\in \mathbb{Z}$. We prove that $HH_{sg}^*(A, A)$ has a Gerstenhaber algebra structure and in the case of a symmetric algebra $A$, $HH_{sg}^*(A, A)$ is a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra."
"The main objective of this paper is to provide a theory for computing the Hochschild cohomology of algebras arising from a linear category with finitely many objects and zero compositions. For this purpose, we consider such a category using an ad hoc quiver $Q$, with an algebra associated to each vertex and a bimodule to each arrow. The computation relies on cohomological functors that we introduce, and on the combinatorics of the quiver. One point extensions are occurrences of this situation, and Happel's long exact sequence is a particular case of the long exact sequence of cohomology that we obtain via the study of trajectories of the quiver. We introduce cohomology along paths, and we compute it under suitable Tor vanishing hypotheses. The cup product on Hochschild cohomology enables us to describe the connecting homomorphism of the long exact sequence.   Algebras arising from a linear category where the quiver is the round trip one, provide square matrix algebras which have two algebras on the diagonal and two bimodules on the corners. If the bimodules are projective, we show that five-terms exact sequences arise. If the bimodules are free of rank one, we provide a complete computation of the Hochschild cohomology. On the other hand, if the corner bimodules are projective without producing new cycles, Hochschild cohomology in large enough degrees is that of the product of the algebras on the diagonal.   As a by-product, we obtain some families of bound quiver algebras which are of infinite global dimension, and have Hochschild cohomology zero in large enough degrees."
"We introduce twisted matrix factorizations for quantum complete intersections of codimension two. For such an algebra, we show that in a given dimension, almost all the indecomposable modules with bounded minimal projective resolutions correspond to such matrix factorizations."
"Let $\mathcal C$ be category over a commutative ring $k$, its Hochschild-Mitchell homology and cohomology are denoted respectively $HH_*(\mathcal C)$ and $HH^*(\mathcal C).$ Let $G$ be a group acting on $\mathcal C$, and $\mathcal C[G]$ be the skew category. We provide decompositions of the (co)homology of $\mathcal C[G]$ along the conjugacy classes of $G$. For Hochschild homology of a $k$-algebra, this corresponds to the decomposition obtained by M. Lorenz.   If the coinvariants and invariants functors are exact, we obtain isomorphisms $\left(HH_*(C)\right)_G\simeq HH^{\{1\}}_* (\mathcal C[G])$ and $\left(HH^*(\mathcal C)\right)^G\simeq HH^*_{\{1\}} (\mathcal C[G]), $ where $\{ {1}\}$ is the trivial conjugacy class of $G$.   We first obtain these isomorphisms in case the action of $G$ is free on the objects of $\mathcal C$. Then we introduce an auxiliary category $M_G(\mathcal C)$ with an action of $G$ which is free on its objects, related to the infinite matrix algebra considered by J. Cornick. This category enables us to show that the isomorphisms hold in general, and in particular for the Hochschild (co)homology of a $k$-algebra with an action of $G$ by automorphisms.   We infer that $\left(HH^*(\mathcal C)\right)^G$ is a canonical direct summand of $HH^*(\mathcal C[G])$. This provides a frame for monomorphisms obtained previously, and which have been described in low degrees."
"We prove that if the Auslander-Reiten triangles generate the relations for the Grothendieck group of a Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt triangulated category with a (co)generator, then the category has only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects up to translation. This gives a triangulated converse to a theorem of Butler and Auslander-Reiten on the relations for Grothendieck groups. Our approach has applications in the context of Frobenius categories."
"In this paper, we will consider a class of locally $\Phi$-Beilinson-Green algebras, where $\Phi$ is an infinite admissible set of the integers, and show that symmetric approximation sequences in $n$-exangulated categories give rise to derived equivalences between quotient algebras of locally $\Phi$-Beilinson-Green algebras in the principal diagonals modulo some factorizable ghost and coghost ideals by the locally finite tilting family. Then we get a class of derived equivalent algebras that have not been obtained by using previous techniques. From higher exact sequences, we obtain derived equivalences between subalgebras of endomorphism algebras by constructing tilting complexes, which generalizes Chen and Xi's result for exact sequences. From a given derived equivalence, we get derived equivalences between locally $\Phi$-Beilinson-Green algebras of semi-Gorenstein modules. Finally, from given graded derived equivalences of group graded algebras, we get derived equivalences between associated Beilinson-Green algebras of group graded algebras."
"Starting with a Grothendieck category $\mathcal{G}$ and a torsion pair $\mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ in $\mathcal G$, we study the local finite presentability and local coherence of the heart $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}}$ of the associated Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} $t$-structure in the derived category $\mathrm{Der} (\mathcal{G})$. We start by showing that, in this general setting, the torsion pair $\mathbf t$ is of finite type, if and only if it is quasi-cotilting, if and only if it is cosilting. We then proceed to study those $\mathbf t$ for which $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}}$ is locally finitely presented, obtaining a complete answer under some additional assumptions on the ground category $\mathcal{G}$, which are general enough to include all locally coherent categories, all categories of modules and several categories of quasi-coherent sheaves over schemes. The third problem that we tackle is that of local coherence. In this direction we characterize those torsion pairs $\mathbf t=(\mathcal T,\mathcal F)$ in a locally finitely presented $\mathcal G$ for which $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}}$ is locally coherent in two cases: when the tilted t-structure in $\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{t}}$ is assumed to restrict to finitely presented objects, and when $\mathcal F$ is cogenerating. In the last part of the paper we concentrate on the case when $\mathcal G$ is a category of modules over a small preadditive category, giving several examples and obtaining very neat (new) characterizations even in this more classical setting, also underlying connections with the notion of an elementary cogenerator."
"Auslander and Kleiner proved in 1994 an abstract version of Green correspondence for pairs of adjoint functors between three categories. They produce additive quotients of certain subcategories giving the classical Green correspondence in the special setting of modular representation theory. Carlson, Peng and Wheeler showed in 1998 that Green correspondence in the classical setting of modular representation theory is actually an equivalence between triangulated categories with respect to a non standard triangulated structure. In the present note we first define and study a version of relative projectivity, respectively relative injectivity with respect to pairs of adjoint functors. We then modify Auslander Kleiner's construction such that the correspondence holds in the setting of triangulated categories."
"For a finite quiver without sinks, we establish an isomorphism in the homotopy category $\mathrm {Ho}(B_\infty)$ of $B_{\infty}$-algebras between the Hochschild cochain complex of the Leavitt path algebra $L$ and the singular Hochschild cochain complex of the corresponding radical square zero algebra $\Lambda$. Combining this isomorphism with a description of the dg singularity category of $\Lambda$ in terms of the dg perfect derived category of $L$, we verify Keller's conjecture for the singular Hochschild cohomology of $\Lambda$. More precisely, we prove that there is an isomorphism in $\mathrm{Ho}(B_\infty)$ between the singular Hochschild cochain complex of $\Lambda$ and the Hochschild cochain complex of the dg singularity category of $\Lambda$. One ingredient of the proof is the following duality theorem on $B_\infty$-algebras: for any $B_\infty$-algebra, there is a natural $B_\infty$-isomorphism between its opposite $B_\infty$-algebra and its transpose $B_\infty$-algebra.   We prove that Keller's conjecture is invariant under one-point (co)extensions and singular equivalences with levels. Consequently, Keller's conjecture holds for those algebras obtained inductively from $\Lambda$ by one-point (co)extensions and singular equivalences with levels. These algebras include all finite dimensional gentle algebras."
"For any finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ given by a quiver with relations, we prove that its dg singularity category is quasi-equivalent to the perfect dg derived category of a dg Leavitt path algebra. The result might be viewed as a deformed version of the known description of the dg singularity category of a radical-square-zero algebra in terms of a Leavitt path algebra with trivial differential.   The above result is achieved in two steps. We first introduce the singular Yoneda dg category of $\Lambda$, which is quasi-equivalent to the dg singularity category of $\Lambda$. The construction of this new dg category follows from a general operation for dg categories, namely an explicit dg localization inverting a natural transformation from the identity functor to a dg endofunctor. This localization turns out to be quasi-equivalent to a dg quotient category. Secondly, we prove that the endomorphism algebra of the quotient of $\Lambda$ modulo its Jacobson radical in the singular Yoneda dg category is isomorphic to the dg Leavitt path algebra. The appendix is devoted to an alternative proof of the result using Koszul-Moore duality and derived localizations."
"In 1989, D. Happel pointed out for a possible connection between the global dimension of a finite-dimensional algebra and its Hochschild cohomology: is it true that the vanishing of Hochschild cohomology higher groups is sufficient to deduce that the global dimension is finite? After the discovery of a counterexample, Y. Han proposed, in 2006, to reformulate this question to homology. In this survey, after introducing the concepts and results involved, I present the efforts made until now towards the comprehension of Han's conjecture; which includes: examples of algebras that have been proven to satisfy it and extensions that preserve it."
"We generalize a recent result by J.F. Carlson to finite tensor categories having finitely generated cohomology. Specifically, we show that if the Krull dimension of the cohomology ring is sufficiently large, then there exist infinitely many non-isomorphic and nontrivial bounded complexes of projective objects, and with small homology. We also prove a version for finite dimensional algebras with finitely generated cohomology."
"The singularity category of a ring detects the homological singularity of the given ring, and appears in many different contexts. We describe two different dg enhancements of the singularity category, that is, the Vogel dg category and the singular Yoneda dg category. These two dg enhancements turn out to be quasi-equivalent. We report some progress on the Singular Presilting Conjecture."
"This paper studies simplicity, primitivity and semiprimitivity of algebras associated to \'etale groupoids. Applications to inverse semigroup algebras are presented. The results also recover the semiprimitivity of Leavitt path algebras and can be used to recover the known primitivity criterion for Leavitt path algebras."
"In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry."
"We construct a family of oriented extended topological field theories using the AKSZ construction in derived algebraic geometry, which can be viewed as an algebraic and topological version of the classical AKSZ field theories that occur in physics. These have as their targets higher categories of symplectic derived stacks, with higher morphisms given by iterated Lagrangian correspondences. We define these, as well as analogous higher categories of oriented derived stacks and iterated oriented cospans, and prove that all objects are fully dualizable. Then we set up a functorial version of the AKSZ construction, first implemented in this context by Pantev-To\""en-Vaqui\'e-Vezzosi, and show that it induces a family of symmetric monoidal functors from oriented stacks to symplectic stacks. Finally, we construct forgetful functors from the unoriented bordism $(\infty,n)$-category to cospans of spaces, and from the oriented bordism $(\infty,n)$-category to cospans of spaces equipped with an orientation; the latter combines with the AKSZ functors by viewing spaces as constant stacks, giving the desired field theories."
"We introduce fusion bialgebras and their duals and systematically study their Fourier analysis. As an application, we discover new efficient analytic obstructions on the unitary categorification of fusion rings. We prove the Hausdorff-Young inequality, uncertainty principles for fusion bialgebras and their duals. We show that the Schur product property, Young's inequality and the sum-set estimate hold for fusion bialgebras, but not always on their duals. If the fusion ring is the Grothendieck ring of a unitary fusion category, then these inequalities hold on the duals. Therefore, these inequalities are analytic obstructions of categorification. We classify simple integral fusion rings of Frobenius type up to rank 8 and of Frobenius-Perron dimension less than 4080. We find 34 ones, 4 of which are group-like and 28 of which can be eliminated by applying the Schur product property on the dual. In general, these inequalities are obstructions to subfactorize fusion bialgebras."
"In this paper, we prove the algebraic K-theory Novikov conjecture for group algebras over the ring of Schatten class operators. The main technical tool in the proof is an explicit construction of the Connes-Chern character."
"Consider a tree $\mathbb T$, all whose vertices have countable valence; its boundary is the Baire space $\mathbb{B} \simeq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb N}$; continued fractions expansions identify the set of irrational numbers $\mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ with $\mathbb B$. Removing $k$ edges from $\mathbb T$ we get a forest consisting of copies of $\mathbb T$. A spheromorphism (or hierarchomorphism) of $\mathbb T$ is an isomorphisms of two such subforests considered as a transformation of $\mathbb T$ or of $\mathbb B$. Denote the group of all spheromorphisms by $\mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T})$. We a show that the correspondence ${\mathbb R}\setminus{\mathbb Q}\simeq{\mathbb B}$ sends the Thompson group realized by piecewise $\mathrm{PSL}_2({\mathbb Z})$-transformations to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T})$. We construct some unitary representations of the group $\mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T})$, show that the group of automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}({\mathbb T})$ is spherical in $\mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T})$, and describe the train (enveloping category) of $\mathrm{Hier}({\mathbb T})$."
"We consider groups $\mathbb{I}$ of isometries of ultrametric Urysohn spaces $\mathbb{U}$. Such spaces $\mathbb{U}$ admit transparent realizations as boundaries of certain $R$-trees and the groups $\mathbb{I}$ are groups of automorphisms of these $R$-trees. Denote by $\mathbb{I}[X]\subset \mathbb{I}$ stabilizers of finite subspaces $X\subset \mathbb{U}$. Double cosets $\mathbb{I}[X]\cdot g\cdot \mathbb{I}[Y]$, where $g\in \mathbb{I}$, are enumerated by ultrametrics on union of spaces $X\cup Y$. We construct natural associative multiplications on double coset spaces $\mathbb{I}[X]\backslash \mathbb{I}/\mathbb{I}[X]$ and, more generally, multiplications $\mathbb{I}[X]\backslash \mathbb{I}/\mathbb{I}[Y]\,\times\, \mathbb{I}[Y]\backslash \mathbb{I}/\mathbb{I}[Z]\to \mathbb{I}[X]\backslash \mathbb{I}/\mathbb{I}[Z]$. These operations are a kind of canonical amalgamations of ultrametric spaces. On the other hand, this product can be interpreted in terms of partial isomorphisms of certain $R$-trees (in particular, we come to an inverse category). This allows us to classify all unitary representations of the groups $\mathbb{I}$ and to prove that groups $\mathbb{I}$ have type $I$. We also describe a universal semigroup compactification of $\mathbb{I}$ whose image in any unitary representation of $\mathbb{I}$ is compact."
"We prove that embeddings of compact groups are equalizers, and a number of results on pushouts (and more generally, amalgamated free products) in the category of compact groups. Call a family of compact-group embeddings $H\le G_i$ algebraically sound if the corresponding group-theoretic pushout embeds in its Bohr compactification. We (a) show that a family of normal embeddings is algebraically sound in the sense that $G_i$ admit embeddings $G_i\le G$ into a compact group which agree on $H$; (b) give equivalent characterizations of coherently embeddable families of normal embeddings in representation-theoretic terms, via Clifford theory; (c) characterize those compact connected Lie groups $H$ for which all finite families of normal embeddings $H\trianglelefteq G_i$ are coherently embeddable (not having central 2-tori is a sufficient, but not necessary condition), and (d) show that families of split embeddings of compact groups are always algebraically sound."
"We introduce the notion of regular finite decomposition complexity of a metric family. This generalizes Gromov's finite asymptotic dimension and is motivated by the concept of finite decomposition complexity (FDC) due to Guentner, Tessera and Yu. Regular finite decomposition complexity implies FDC and has all the permanence properties that are known for FDC, as well as a new one called Finite Quotient Permanence. We show that for a collection containing all metric families with finite asymptotic dimension all other permanence properties follow from Fibering Permanence."
"This paper is a systematic approach to the construction of coronas (i.e. Higson dominated boundaries at infinity) of combable spaces. We introduce three additional properties for combings: properness, coherence and expandingness. Properness is the condition under which our construction of the corona works. Under the assumption of coherence and expandingness, attaching our corona to a Rips complex construction yields a contractible $\sigma$-compact space in which the corona sits as a $Z$-set. This results in bijectivity of transgression maps, injectivity of the coarse assembly map and surjectivity of the coarse co-assembly map. For groups we get an estimate on the cohomological dimension of the corona in terms of the asymptotic dimension. Furthermore, if the group admits a finite model for its classifying space $BG$, then our constructions yield a $Z$-structure for the group."
"In this paper we construct a new variant of the Weil representation, associated with a symplectic vector space V defined over a finite field of characteristic two. Our variant is a representation of a bigger group than that of Weil. In the course, we develop the formalism of canonical vector spaces, which enables us to realize the bigger symmetry group and the representation in a transparent manner."
"DQ-algebroids locally defined on a symplectic manifold form a 2-gerbe. By adapting the method of P. Deligne to the setting of DQ-algebroids we show that this 2-gerbe admits a canonical global section, namely that every symplectic manifold admits a canonical DQ-algebroid quantizing the structure sheaf. The construction relies on methods of non-abelian cohomology and local computations in the Weyl algebra. As a corollary we obtain a classification of symplectic DQ-algebroids."
"We show, finitely generated rational $\mathsf{VIC}_{\mathbb Q}$-modules and $\mathsf{SI}_{\mathbb Q}$-modules are uniformly representation stable and all their submodules are finitely generated. We use this to prove two conjectures of Church and Farb, which state that the quotients of the lower central series of the Torelli subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ and $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_{g,1})$ are uniformly representation stable as sequences of representations of the general linear groups and the symplectic groups, respectively. Furthermore we prove an analogous statement for their Johnson filtrations."
"We introduce the notion of the power quandle of a group, an algebraic structure that forgets the multiplication but keeps the conjugation and the power maps. Compared with plain quandles, power quandles are much better invariants of groups. We show that they determine the central quotient of any group and the center of any finite group. Any group can be canonically approximated by the associated group of its power quandle, which we show to be a central extension, with a universal property, and a computable kernel. This allows us to present any group as a quotient of a group with a power-conjugation presentation by an abelian subgroup that is determined by the power quandle and low-dimensional homological invariants."
"The paper has been withdrawn by the author, due a gap in the proof of Theorem 6.1. The gap was discovered by M. Van den Bergh.   Theorem 6.1 is used to prove the main result of the paper, namely Theorem 0.7 (decomposition in arbitrary characteristic). At this time we do not have an alternate proof.   Other results of the paper (Theorems 0.2, 0.3, 0.6 and 3.1) are not effected by this problem, and they remain valid."
"We develop a framework for computing the homology of weighted simplicial complexes with coefficients in a discrete valuation ring. A weighted simplicial complex, $(X,v)$, introduced by Dawson [Cah. Topol. G\'{e}om. Diff\'{e}r. Cat\'{e}g. 31 (1990), pp. 229--243], is a simplicial complex, $X$, together with an integer-valued function, $v$, assigning weights to simplices, such that the weight of any of faces are monotonously increasing. In addition, weighted homology, $H_n^v(X)$, features a new boundary operator, $\partial_n^v$. In difference to Dawson, our approach is centered at a natural homomorphism $\theta$ of weighted chain complexes. The key object is $H^v_{n}(X/\theta)$, the weighted homology of a quotient of chain complexes induced by $\theta$, appearing in a long exact sequence linking weighted homologies with different weights. We shall construct bases for the kernel and image of the weighted boundary map, identifying $n$-simplices as either $\kappa_n$- or $\mu_n$-vertices. Long exact sequences of weighted homology groups and the bases, allow us to prove a structure theorem for the weighted simplicial homology with coefficients in a ring of formal power series $R=\mathbb{F}[[\pi]]$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a field. Relative to simplicial homology new torsion arises and we shall show that the torsion modules are connected to a pairing between distinguished $\kappa_n$ and $\mu_{n+1}$ simplices."
"We prove a number of results linking properties of actions by compact groups (both quantum and classical) on Banach spaces, such as uniform continuity, spectrum finiteness and extensibility of the actions across several constructions. Examples include: (a) a unitary representation of a compact quantum group induces a continuous action on the $C^*$-algebra of bounded operators if and only if it has finitely many isotypic components, and hence is uniformly continuous; (b) a compact quantum group is finite if and only if its continuous actions on $C^*$-algebras lift to continuous actions on either the multiplier algebras or von Neumann envelopes thereof; (c) a (classical) locally compact group $\mathbb{G}$ is discrete if and only if the forgetful functor from $\mathbb{G}$-acted-upon compact $T_2$ spaces back to compact $T_2$ spaces creates coproducts; (d) a representation of a linearly reductive quantum group has finitely many isotypic components if and only if its restrictions to two topologically-generating quantum subgroups, one of which is normal, do; (e) equivalent characterizations of uniform continuity for actions of compact groups on Banach spaces, e.g. that such an action is uniformly continuous if and only if its restrictions to a pro-torus and to pro-$p$ subgroups are."
"In a category with enough limits and colimits, one can form the universal automorphism on an endomorphism in two dual senses. Sometimes these dual constructions coincide, as in the categories of finite sets, finite-dimensional vector spaces, and compact metric spaces. There, beginning with an endomorphism $f$, there is a doubly-universal automorphism on $f$ whose underlying object is the eventual image $\bigcap_n \mathrm{im}(f^n)$. Our main theorem unifies these examples, stating that in any category with a factorization system satisfying certain axioms, the eventual image has two dual universal properties. A further theorem characterizes the eventual image as a terminal coalgebra. In all, nine characterizations of the eventual image are given, valid at different levels of generality."
"We construct KMS-states from $\mathrm{Li}_1$-summable semifinite spectral triples and show that in several important examples the construction coincides with well-known direct constructions of KMS-states for naturally defined flows. Under further summability assumptions the constructed KMS-state can be computed in terms of Dixmier traces. For closed manifolds, we recover the ordinary Lebesgue integral. For Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with their gauge flow, the construction produces KMS-states from traces on the coefficient algebra and recovers the Laca-Neshveyev correspondence. For a discrete group acting on its Stone-\v{C}ech boundary, we recover the Patterson-Sullivan measures on the Stone-\v{C}ech boundary for a flow defined from the Radon-Nikodym cocycle."
"Generalizing the case of an infinite discrete metric space of finite diameter, we say that a discrete metric space $(X,d)$ is a Kuiper space, if the group of invertible elements of its uniform Roe algebra is norm-contractible. Various sufficient conditions on $(X,d)$ to be or not to be a Kuiper space are obtained."
"Hereditarily indecomposable Banach spaces may have density at most continuum (Plichko-Yost, Argyros-Tolias). In this paper we show that this cannot be proved for indecomposable Banach spaces. We provide the first example of an indecomposable Banach space of density two to continuum. The space exists consistently, is of the form C(K) and it has few operators in the sense that any bounded linear operator T on C(K) satisfies T(f)=gf+S(f) for every f in C(K), where g is in C(K) and S is weakly compact (strictly singular)."
"Assuming the generalized continuum hypothesis we construct arbitrarily big indecomposable Banach spaces. i.e., such that whenever they are decomposed as $X\oplus Y$, then one of the closed subspaces $X$ or $Y$ must be finite dimensional. It requires alternative techniques compared to those which were initiated by Gowers and Maurey or Argyros with the coauthors. This is because hereditarily indecomposable Banach spaces always embed into $\ell_\infty$ and so their density and cardinality is bounded by the continuum and because dual Banach spaces of densities bigger than continuum are decomposable by a result due to Heinrich and Mankiewicz.   The obtained Banach spaces are of the form $C(K)$ for some compact connected Hausdorff space and have few operators in the sense that every linear bounded operator $T$ on $C(K)$ for every $f\in C(K)$ satisfies $T(f)=gf+S(f)$ where $g\in C(K)$ and $S$ is weakly compact or equivalently strictly singular. In particular, the spaces carry the structure of a Banach algebra and in the complex case even the structure of a $C^*$-algebra."
"A C*-algebra $A$ is said to be stable if it is isomorphic to $A \otimes K(\ell_2)$. Hjelmborg and R\o rdam have shown that countable inductive limits of separable stable C*-algebras are stable. We show that this is no longer true in the nonseparable context even for the most natural case of an uncountable inductive limit of an increasing chain of separable stable and AF ideals: we construct a GCR, AF (in fact, scattered) subalgebra $A$ of $B(\ell_2)$, which is the inductive limit of length $\omega_1$ of its separable stable ideals $I_\alpha$ ($\alpha<\omega_1$) satisfying $I_{\alpha+1}/I_\alpha\cong K(\ell_2)$ for each $\alpha<\omega_1$, while $A$ is not stable.   The sequence $(I_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq\omega_1}$ is the GCR composition series of $A$ which in this case coincides with the Cantor-Bendixson composition series as a scattered C*-algebra. $A$ has the property that all of its proper two-sided ideals are listed as $I_\alpha$s for some $\alpha<\omega_1$ and therefore the family of stable ideals of $A$ has no maximal element.   By taking $A'=A\otimes K(\ell_2)$ we obtain a stable C*-algebra with analogous composition series $(J_\alpha)_{\alpha<\omega_1}$ whose ideals $J_\alpha$s are isomorphic to $I_\alpha$s for each $\alpha<\omega_1$. In particular, there are nonisomorphic scattered C*-algebras whose GCR composition series $(I_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq\omega_1}$ satisfy $I_{\alpha+1}/I_\alpha\cong K(\ell_2)$ for all $\alpha<\omega_1$, for which the composition series differ first at $\alpha=\omega_1$."
"We investigate Banach space automorphisms $T:\ell_\infty/c_0\rightarrow\ell_\infty/c_0 $ focusing on the possibility of representing their fragments of the form $$T_{B,A}:\ell_\infty(A)/c_0(A)\rightarrow \ell_\infty(B)/c_0(B)$$ for $A, B\subseteq N$ infinite by means of linear operators from $\ell_\infty(A)$ into $\ell_\infty(B)$, infinite $A\times B$-matrices, continuous maps from $B^*=\beta B\setminus B$ into $A^*$, or bijections from $B$ to $A$. This leads to the analysis of general linear operators on $\ell_\infty/c_0$. We present many examples, introduce and investigate several classes of operators, for some of them we obtain satisfactory representations and for other give examples showing that it is impossible. In particular, we show that there are automorphisms of $\ell_\infty/c_0$ which cannot be lifted to operators on $\ell_\infty$ and assuming OCA+MA we show that every automorphism of $\ell_\infty/c_0$ with no fountains or with no funnels is locally, i.e., for some infinite $A, B\subseteq N$ as above, induced by a bijection from $B$ to $A$. This additional set-theoretic assumption is necessary as we show that the continuum hypothesis implies the existence of counterexamples of diverse flavours. However, many basic problems, some of which are listed in the last section, remain open."
"We construct an essential extension of $\mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}}))$ by $\mathcal K(\ell_2)$, where ${\mathfrak{c}}$ denotes the cardinality of continuum, i.e., a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A\subseteq \mathcal B(\ell_2)$ satisfying the short exact sequence $$0\rightarrow \mathcal K(\ell_2)\xrightarrow{\iota} \mathcal A \rightarrow\mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}}))\rightarrow 0,$$ where $\iota[\mathcal K(\ell_2)]$ is an essential ideal of $\mathcal A$ such that the algebra of multipliers $\mathcal M(\mathcal A)$ of $\mathcal A$ is equal to the unitization of $\mathcal A$. In particular $\mathcal A$ is not stable which sheds light on permanence properties of the stability in the nonseparable setting. Namely, an extension of a nonseparable algebra of compact operators, even by $\mathcal K(\ell_2)$, does not have to be stable.   This construction can be considered as a noncommutative version of Mr\'owka's $\Psi$-space; a space whose one point compactification equals to its Cech-Stone compactification and is induced by a special uncountable family of almost disjoint subsets of ${\mathbb{N}}$. The role of the almost disjoint family is played by an almost orthogonal family of projections in $\mathcal B(\ell_2)$, but the almost matrix units corresponding to the matrix units in $\mathcal K(\ell_2({\mathfrak{c}}))$ must be constructed with extra care.   This example may also contribute in the future to our understanding of the semigroups $Ext(\mathcal K(\ell_2({\kappa})))$ for $\omega_1\leq \kappa\leq\mathfrak{c}$ which are unexplored at the moment."
"We analyze the sequence obtained by consecutive applications of the Cantor-Bendixson derivative for a noncommutative scattered $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, using the ideal $\mathcal I^{At}(\mathcal A)$ generated by the minimal projections of $\mathcal A$. With its help, we present some fundamental results concerning scattered $C^*$-algebras, in a manner parallel to the commutative case of scattered compact or locally compact Hausdorff spaces and superatomic Boolean algebras. It also allows us to formulate problems which have motivated the ""cardinal sequences"" programme in the classical topology, in the noncommutative context.   This leads to some new constructions of noncommutative scattered $C^*$-algebras and new open problems. In particular, we construct a type $I$ $C^*$-algebra which is the inductive limit of stable ideals $\mathcal A_\alpha$, along an uncountable limit ordinal $\lambda$, such that $\mathcal A_{\alpha+1}/\mathcal A_\alpha$ is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra of all compact operators on a separable Hilbert space and $\mathcal A_{\alpha+1}$ is $\sigma$-unital and stable for each $\alpha<\lambda$, but $\mathcal A$ is not stable and where all ideals of $\mathcal A$ are of the form $\mathcal A_\alpha$. In particular, $\mathcal A$ is a nonseparable $C^*$-algebra with no ideal which is maximal among the stable ideals.   This answers a question of M. R\ordam in the nonseparable case. All the above $C^*$-algebras $A_\alpha$s and $A$ satisfy the following version of the definition of an AF algebra: any finite subset can be approximated from a finite-dimensional subalgebra. Two more complex constructions based on the language developed in this paper are presented in separate papers."
"In this note, we propose a simple-looking but broad conjecture about star-algebras over the field of real numbers. The conjecture enables many matrix decompositions to be represented by star-algebras and star-ideals. This paper is written for people with a background in representation theory and module theory. The motivation for investigating this is the possibility of expressing polymorphic algorithms in numerical and theoretical linear algebra. This is similar to but different from algebraic (semiring based) approaches to dynamic programming. We prove certain cases of the conjecture."
"This is a non-standard paper, containing some problems in set theory I have in various degrees been interested in. Sometimes with a discussion on what I have to say; sometimes, of what makes them interesting to me, sometimes the problems are presented with a discussion of how I have tried to solve them, and sometimes with failed tries, anecdote and opinion. So the discussion is quite personal, in other words, egocentric and somewhat accidental. As we discuss many problems, history and side references are erratic, usually kept at a minimum (``see ... '' means: see the references there and possibly the paper itself).   The base were lectures in Rutgers Fall'97 and reflect my knowledge then. The other half, concentrating on model theory, will subsequently appear."
"We study representations of MV-algebras -- equivalently, unital lattice-ordered abelian groups -- through the lens of Stone-Priestley duality, using canonical extensions as an essential tool. Specifically, the theory of canonical extensions implies that the (Stone-Priestley) dual spaces of MV-algebras carry the structure of topological partial commutative ordered semigroups. We use this structure to obtain two different decompositions of such spaces, one indexed over the prime MV-spectrum, the other over the maximal MV-spectrum. These decompositions yield sheaf representations of MV-algebras, using a new and purely duality-theoretic result that relates certain sheaf representations of distributive lattices to decompositions of their dual spaces. Importantly, the proofs of the MV-algebraic representation theorems that we obtain in this way are distinguished from the existing work on this topic by the following features: (1) we use only basic algebraic facts about MV-algebras; (2) we show that the two aforementioned sheaf representations are special cases of a common result, with potential for generalizations; and (3) we show that these results are strongly related to the structure of the Stone-Priestley duals of MV-algebras. In addition, using our analysis of these decompositions, we prove that MV-algebras with isomorphic underlying lattices have homeomorphic maximal MV-spectra. This result is an MV-algebraic generalization of a classical theorem by Kaplansky stating that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if, and only if, the lattices of continuous [0, 1]-valued functions on the spaces are isomorphic."
"Lindenhovius has studied Grothendieck topologies on posets and has given a complete classification in the case that the poset is Artinian. We extend his approach to more general posets, by translating known results in locale and domain theory to the study of Grothendieck topologies. In particular, explicit descriptions are given for the family of Grothendieck topologies with enough points and the family of Grothendieck topologies of finite type. As an application, we compute the cardinalities of these families in various examples."
"Let X be a topological space. The homology of the iterated loop space $H_*\Omega^n X$ is an algebra over the homology of the framed n-disks operad $H_*f\mathcal{D}_n$ \cite{Getzler:BVAlg,Salvatore-Wahl:FrameddoBVa}. We determine completely this $H_*f\mathcal{D}_n$-algebra structure on   $H_*(\Omega^n X;\mathbb{Q})$. We show that the action of $H_*(SO(n))$ on the iterated loop space $H_*\Omega^n X$ is related to the J-homomorphism and that the BV-operator vanishes on spherical classes only in characteristic other than 2."
"The aim of this paper is to introduce an approach to the (strong) Novikov conjecture based on continuous families of finite dimensional representations: this is partly inspired by ideas of Lusztig using the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem, and partly by Carlsson's deformation $K$--theory. Using this approach, we give new proofs of the strong Novikov conjecture in several interesting cases, including crystallographic groups and surface groups. The method presented here is relatively accessible compared with other proofs of the Novikov conjecture, and also yields some information about the $K$--theory and cohomology of representation spaces."
"Let $F$ be a finite group. We consider the lamplighter group $L=F\wr\mathbb{Z}$ over $F$. We prove that $L$ has a classifying space for proper actions $\underline{E} L$ which is a complex of dimension two. We use this to give an explicit proof of the Baum-Connes conjecture (without coefficients), that states that the assembly map $\mu_i^L:K_i^L(\underline{E} L)\rightarrow K_i(C^*L)\;(i=0,1)$ is an isomorphism. Actually, $K_0(C^*L)$ is free abelian of countable rank, with an explicit basis consisting of projections in $C^*L$, while $K_1(C^*L)$ is infinite cyclic, generated by the unitary of $C^*L$ implementing the shift. Finally we show that, for $F$ abelian, the $C^*$-algebra $C^*L$ is completely characterized by $|F|$ up to isomorphism."
"We consider the semi-direct products $G=\mathbb Z^2\rtimes GL_2(\mathbb Z), \mathbb Z^2\rtimes SL_2(\mathbb Z)$ and $\mathbb Z^2\rtimes\Gamma(2)$ (where $\Gamma(2)$ is the congruence subgroup of level 2). For each of them, we compute both sides of the Baum-Connes conjecture, namely the equivariant $K$-homology of the classifying space $\underline{E}G$ for proper actions on the left-hand side, and the analytical K-theory of the reduced group $C^*$-algebra on the right-hand side. The computation of the LHS is made possible by the existence of a 3-dimensional model for $\underline{E}G$, which allows to replace equivariant K-homology by Bredon homology. We pay due attention to the presence of torsion in $G$, leading to an extensive study of the wallpaper groups associated with finite subgroups. For the second and third groups, the computations in $K_0$ provide explicit generators that are matched by the Baum-Connes assembly map."
"We prove the $K$-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture for groups as in the title with coefficient rings and $C^*$-algebras which are stable with respect to compact operators. We use this and Higson-Kasparov's result that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients holds for such groups, to show that if $G$ is as in the title then the algebraic and the $C^*$-crossed products of $G$ with a stable $C^*$-algebra have the same $K$-theory."
"Consider the wreath product $\Gamma = F\wr \mathrm{F_n} = \bigoplus_{\mathrm{F_n}}F\rtimes\mathrm{F_n}$, with $F$ a finite group and $\mathrm{F_n}$ the free group on $n$ generators. We study the Baum-Connes conjecture for this group. Our aim is to explicitly describe the Baum-Connes assembly map for $F\wr \mathrm{F_n}$. To this end, we compute the topological and the analytical K-groups and exhibit their generators. Moreover, we present a concrete 2-dimensional model for $\underline{E} \Gamma$. As a result of our K-theoretic computations, we obtain that $\mathrm K_0(\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\Gamma))$ is the free abelian group of countable rank with a basis consisting of projections in $\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\bigoplus_{\mathrm{F_n}}F)$ and $\mathrm K_1(\mathrm C^*_{\mathrm r}(\Gamma))$ is the free abelian group of rank $n$ with a basis consisting of the unitaries coming from the free group."
"Extended Khovanov arc algebras $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ are graded associative algebras which naturally appear in a variety of contexts, from knot and link homology, low-dimensional topology and topological quantum field theory to representation theory and symplectic geometry. C. Stroppel conjectured in her ICM 2010 address that the bigraded Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ vanish in a certain range, implying that the algebras $\mathrm K_m^n$ admit no nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations, in particular that the algebras are intrinsically formal.   Whereas Stroppel's Conjecture is known to hold for the algebras $\mathrm K_m^1$ and $\mathrm K_1^n$ by work of Seidel and Thomas, we show that $\mathrm K_m^n$ does in fact admit nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations with nonvanishing higher products for all $m, n \geq 2$.   We describe both $\mathrm K_m^n$ and its Koszul dual concretely as path algebras of quivers with relations and give an explicit algebraic construction of A$_\infty$ deformations of $\mathrm K_m^n$ by using the correspondence between A$_\infty$ deformations of a Koszul algebra and filtered associative deformations of its Koszul dual. These deformations can also be viewed as A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya--Seidel categories associated to Hilbert schemes of surfaces based on recent work of Mak and Smith."
"Let $\mathcal{C}(S^{m})$ denote the set of continuous maps from the unit sphere $S^{m}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ into itself endowed with the supremum norm. We prove that the set $\{f^n: f\in \mathcal{C}(S^{m})~\text{and}~n\ge 2\}$ of iterated maps is not dense in $\mathcal{C}(S^{m})$. This, in particular, proves that the periodic points of the iteration operator of order $n$ are not dense in $\mathcal{C}(S^m)$ for all $n\ge 2$, providing an alternative proof of the result that these operators are not Devaney chaotic on $\mathcal{C}(S^m)$ proved in [M. Veerapazham, C. Gopalakrishna, W. Zhang, Dynamics of the iteration operator on the space of continuous self-maps, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 149(1) (2021), 217--229]."
"When a solenoid is embedded in three space, its complement is an open three manifold. We discuss the geometry and fundamental groups of such manifolds, and show that the complements of different solenoids (arising from different inverse limits) have different fundamental groups. Embeddings of the same solenoid can give different groups; in particular, the nicest embeddings are unknotted at each level, and give an Abelian fundamental group, while other embeddings have non-Abelian groups. We show using geometry that every solenoid has uncountably many embeddings with non-homeomorphic complements."
"We prove that any countable discrete and torsion free subgroup of a general linear group over an arbitrary field or a similar subgroup of an almost connected Lie group satisfies the integral algebraic K-theoretic (split) Novikov conjecture over \cpt and \S, where \cpt denotes the C^*-algebra of compact operators and \S denotes the algebra of Schatten class operators. We introduce assembly maps with finite coefficients and under an additional hypothesis, we prove that such a group also satisfies the algebraic K-theoretic Novikov conjecture over \bar{\mathbb{Q}} and \mathbb{C} with finite coefficients. For all torsion free Gromov hyperbolic groups G, we demonstrate that the canonical algebra homomorphism \cpt[G]\map C^*_r(G)\hat{\otimes}\cpt induces an isomorphism between their algebraic K-theory groups."
We prove the existence of a map of spectra $\tau_A \colon kA \to lA$ between connective topological K-theory and connective algebraic L-theory of a complex $C^*$-algebra A which is natural in A and compatible with multiplicative structures. We determine its effect on homotopy groups and as a consequence obtain a natural equivalence $KA[1/2] \to LA[1/2]$ of periodic K- and L-theory spectra after inverting 2. We show that this equivalence extends to K- and L-theory of real $C^*$-algebras. Using this we give a comparison between the real Baum-Connes conjecture and the L-theoretic Farrell-Jones conjecture. We conclude that these conjectures are equivalent after inverting 2 if and only if a certain completion conjecture in L-theory is true.
In the present paper we investigate the question about the injectivity of the map F(R) --> F(K) induced by the canonical inclusion of a local regular ring of geometric type R to its field of fractions K for a homotopy invariant functor F with transfers satisfying some additional properties. As an application we get the original proof of Special Unitary Case of Grothendieck's conjecture about principal homogeneous spaces and some other interesting examples.
"The paper combines several fortunate mini miracles to achieve its two objectives. These were woven together in a several year's effort to answer a question raised by Iz Singer a decade ago. Our answer is accessible to the topologist, to the differential geometer and to the analyst who appreciates the statement of the Index theorem of Atiyah,Patodi,Singer for manifolds with boundary. The mini miracles are these: a] The Conner Floyd miracle that complex bordism tensored over the Todd genus and the Bott miracle that stable complex vector bundles respectively satisfy the axioms of a generalized homology theory and of a generalized cohomology theory. b] That these theories, with the covariant and contravariant geometric representations indicated, stably almost complex (SAC) manifolds modulo product relations and stable complex bundles, are not only related by Alexander duality but they are also related by Pontryagin duality. c] The abstract corollary of b] that stable complex bundles have a complete system of numerical invariants and that these can be computed by integrals of chern weil characteristic forms over manifolds with boundary reduced modulo integers, thanks to the APS Index Theorem. d] The adiabatic limit argument of the appendix to the last section showing a direct sum connection on the total space of a riemannian family of Riemannian manifolds with connection is Chern Simons equivalent in the limit to the Levi Civita connection of the direct sum metric. This allows the invariants to be described by the eta invariants of odd SAC manifolds reduced mod integers."
Summary of main work 1999-2012
"We prove that if the $n$th $\ell^2$-Betti number of a group is non-zero then its $n$th BNSR invariant over $\mathbb{Q}$ is empty, under suitable finiteness conditions. We apply this to answer questions of Friedl--Vidussi and Llosa Isenrich--Py about aspherical K\""ahler manifolds, to verify some cases of the Singer Conjecture, and to compute certain BNSR invariants of poly-free and poly-surface groups."
In a very celebrated paper A. Connes has formulated a conjecture which is now one of the most important open problem in Operator Algebras. This importance comes from the works of many mathematicians who have found some unexpected equivalent statements showing as this conjecture is transversal to almost all the sub-specialization of Operator Algebras. In this survey I would like to give a more or less detailed description of all these approaches.
We show that the global and local constructions of three types of blowup of a smooth manifold along a closed submanifold in differential topology are equivalent.
"Systematically using the language of groupoids, we survey the theory of global Mackey functors, global Green functors and global power functors. Given a global power functor, we study rings with similar operations. The example of n-class functions leads to the notion of an n-special lambda ring."
"We extend the theory of Mackey 2-functors introduced in arXiv:1808.04902 by defining the appropriate notion of rings, namely Green 2-functors. After providing the first results of our theory and abundant examples, we show how all classical Green functors familiar from representation theory and topology arise by decategorification, in various ways, of some Green 2-functor occurring in Nature."
"We prove that for a coarse space $X$ the ideal $S(X)$ of small subsets of $X$ coincides with the ideal $D_<(X)$ of subsets $A\subset X$ of asymptotic dimension $asdim(A)<asdim(X)$ provided that $X$ is coarsely equivalent to an Euclidean space $R^n$. Also we prove that for a locally compact Abelian group $X$, the equality $S(X)=D_<(X)$ holds if and only if the group $X$ is compactly generated."
"Let $G$ be a group of homeomorphisms of a topological space $X$. $G$ is $\textit{(properly) isometrizable}$ if there exists a $G$-invariant (proper) gauge structure on $X$. $G$ is $\textit{equiregular}$ if for every $x \in X$ and every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ there is an open neighborhood $V$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $cl(V) \subset U$ and every $y \in X$ has an open neighborhood $N_y$ with the property that for every $g \in G$, if $g(N_y) \cap cl(V) \neq \emptyset$, then $g(N_y) \subset U$. $G$ is $\textit{nearly proper}$ if for all compact subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$, $cl$ ( $\bigcup$ { $g(A):g\in G$ and $g(A)\cap B \neq \emptyset$ } ) is compact. $G$ $\textit{acts properly on}$ $X$ if for all compact subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$, the subset $G_{A,B}$ = { $g\in G : g(A) \cap B \neq \emptyset$ } is compact when $G$ is endowed with the compact-open topology.   THE ISOMETRIZATION THEOREM: If $X$ is a Hausdorff space and $G$ \ $X$ is a paracompact regular space, then: $G$ is isometrizable if and only if $G$ is equiregular.   THE PROPER ISOMETRIZATION THEOREM: If $X$ is a locally compact $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space and $G$ \ $X$ is a regular space, then: $G$ is properly isometrizable if and only if $G$ is equiregular and nearly proper.   The PROPER ISOMETRIZATION THEOREM has the following corollary.   THEOREM OF ABEL-MANOUSSOS-NOSKOV: If $X$ is a locally compact $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space and $G$ acts properly on $X$, then $X$ is properly isometrizable."
"This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the \v{C}ech cohomology functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ taking values in the category $\mathsf{GPC}$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to provide strong solutions to higher-dimensional and equivariant generalizations of a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement $S^3\backslash\Sigma$ to the $2$-sphere.   In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of \v{C}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics."
This is a brief introduction to the world of Noncommutative Algebra aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.
"Floer field theory is a construction principle for e.g. 3-manifold invariants via decomposition in a bordism category and a functor to the symplectic category, and is conjectured to have natural 4-dimensional extensions. This survey provides an introduction to the categorical language for the construction and extension principles and provides the basic intuition for two gauge theoretic examples which conceptually frame Atiyah-Floer type conjectures in Donaldson theory as well as the relations of Heegaard Floer homology to Seiberg-Witten theory."
"To every scheme, not necessarily smooth neither proper, we can associate its different mixed realizations (de Rham, Betti, etale, Hodge, etc) as well as its ring of periods. In this note, following an insight of Kontsevich, we prove that, after suitable modifications, these classical constructions can be extended from schemes to the broad setting of dg categories. This leads to new additive invariants, which we compute in the case of differential operators, as well as to a theory of periods of dg categories. Among other applications, we prove that the ring of periods of a scheme is invariant under projective homological duality. Along the way, we explicitly describe the modified mixed realizations using the Tannakian formalism."
"We expose a K-theoretic approach to study group C*-algebras and C*-algebraic compact quantum groups: 1. The conception of multidimensional geometric quantization and the index of group C*-algebras; 2. the entire homology of noncommutative de Rham currents and the noncommutative Chern characters, and their computation for C*-algebras of compact Lie groups and compact quantum groups."
"Any rational number can be factored into a product of several rationals whose sum vanishes. This simple but nontrivial fact was suggested as a problem on a maths olympiad for high-school students. We completely solve similar questions in all finite fields and in some other rings, e.g., in the complex and real matrix algebras. Also, we state several open questions."
"We prove that, in any field of characteristic not two and not three except the five-element field, each element decomposes into a product of four factors whose sum vanishes. We also find all $k,n,q$ such that every $n\times n$ matrix over the $q$-element field decomposes into a product of $k$ commuting matrices whose sum vanishes."
This paper continues our previous work done in math.AG/0008207 and is an attempt to establish a conceptual framework which generalizes the work of Manin on the relation between non-linear second order ODEs of type Painleve VI and integrable systems. The principle behind everything is a strong interaction between K-theory and Picard-Fuchs type differential equations via Abel-Jacobi maps. Our main result is an extension of a theorem of Donagi and Markman to our setup.
"Cauchy's contribution to the foundations of analysis is often viewed through the lens of developments that occurred some decades later, namely the formalisation of analysis on the basis of the epsilon-delta doctrine in the context of an Archimedean continuum. What does one see if one refrains from viewing Cauchy as if he had read Weierstrass already? One sees, with Felix Klein, a parallel thread for the development of analysis, in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum. One sees, with Emile Borel, the seeds of the theory of rates of growth of functions as developed by Paul du Bois-Reymond. One sees, with E. G. Bjorling, an infinitesimal definition of the criterion of uniform convergence. Cauchy's foundational stance is hereby reconsidered."
"We calculate the K-theory of the Cuntz-Krieger algebra ${\cal O}_E$ associated with an infinite, locally finite graph, via the Bass-Hashimoto operator. The formulae we get express the Grothendieck group and the Whitehead group in purely graph theoretic terms.   We consider the category of finite (black-and-white, bi-directed) subgraphs with certain graph homomorphisms and construct a continuous functor to abelian groups. In this category $K_0$ is an inductive limit of $K$-groups of finite graphs, which were calculated in \cite{MM}.   In the case of an infinite graph with the finite Betti number we obtain the formula for the Grothendieck group $K_0({\cal O}_E)= {\mathbb Z}^{\beta(E)+\gamma(E)},\,$ where $\beta(E)$ is the first Betti number and $\gamma(E)$ is the valency number of the graph $E$. We note, that in the infinite case the torsion part of $K_0$, which is present in the case of a finite graph, vanishes. The Whitehead group depends only on the first Betti number: $K_1({\cal O}_E)= {\mathbb Z}^{\beta(E)}$. These allow us to provide a counterexample to the fact, which holds for finite graphs, that $K_1({\cal O}_E)$ is the torsion free part of $K_0({\cal O}_E)$."
"`Categorification' is the process of replacing equations by isomorphisms. We describe some of the ways a thoroughgoing emphasis on categorification can simplify and unify mathematics. We begin with elementary arithmetic, where the category of finite sets serves as a categorified version of the set of natural numbers, with disjoint union and Cartesian product playing the role of addition and multiplication. We sketch how categorifying the integers leads naturally to the infinite loop space Omega^infinity S^infinity, and how categorifying the positive rationals leads naturally to a notion of the `homotopy cardinality' of a tame space. Then we show how categorifying formal power series leads to Joyal's `especes des structures', or `structure types'. We also describe a useful generalization of structure types called `stuff types'. There is an inner product of stuff types that makes the category of stuff types into a categorified version of the Hilbert space of the quantized harmonic oscillator. We conclude by sketching how this idea gives a nice explanation of the combinatorics of Feynman diagrams."
"In this paper we identify the cotangent to the derived stack of representations of a quiver $Q$ with the derived moduli stack of modules over the Ginzburg dg-algebra associated with $Q$. More generally, we extend this result to finite type dg-categories, to a relative setting as well, and to deformations of these. It allows us to recover and generalize some results of Yeung, and leads us to the discovery of seemingly new lagrangian subvarieties in the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane."
"We study amenability of definable and topological groups.   Among our main technical tools is an elaboration on and strengthening of the Massicot-Wagner version of the stabilizer theorem, and some results around measures.   As an application we show that if $G$ is an amenable topological group, then the Bohr compactification of $G$ coincides with a certain ""weak Bohr compactification"" introduced in [24]. Formally, $G^{00}_{topo} = G^{000}_{topo}$. We also prove wide generalizations of this result, implying in particular its extension to a ""definable-topological"" context, confirming the main conjectures from [24].   We introduce $\bigvee$-definable group topologies on a given $\emptyset$-definable group $G$ (including group topologies induced by type-definable subgroups as well as uniformly definable group topologies), and prove that the existence of a mean on the lattice of closed, type-definable subsets of $G$ implies (under some assumption) that $cl(G^{00}_M) = cl(G^{000}_M)$ for any model $M$.   We study the relationship between definability of an action of a definable group on a compact space, weakly almost periodic actions, and stability. We conclude that for any group $G$ definable in a sufficiently saturated structure, every definable action of $G$ on a compact space supports a $G$-invariant probability measure. This gives negative solutions to some questions and conjectures from [22] and [24].   We give an example of a $\emptyset$-definable approximate subgroup $X$ in a saturated extension of the group $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$ in a suitable language for which the $\bigvee$-definable group $H:=\langle X \rangle$ contains no type-definable subgroup of bounded index. This refutes a conjecture by Wagner and shows that the Massicot-Wagner approach to prove that a locally compact ""model"" exists for each approximate subgroup does not work in general."
"We give an explicit description for a basis of a subgroup of finite index in the group of central units of the integral group ring $\Z G$ of a finite abelian-by-supersolvable group such that every cyclic subgroup of order not a divisor of 4 or 6 is subnormal in $G$. The basis elements turn out to be a natural product of conjugates of Bass units. This extends and generalizes a result of Jespers, Parmenter and Sehgal showing that the Bass units generate a subgroup of finite index in the center $\mathcal{Z} (\U (\Z G))$ of the unit group $\U (\Z G)$ in case $G$ is a finite nilpotent group. Next, we give a new construction of units that generate a subgroup of finite index in $\mathcal{Z}(\U(\Z G))$ for all finite strongly monomial groups $G$. We call these units generalized Bass units. Finally, we show that the commutator group $\U(\Z G)/\U(\Z G)'$ and $\mathcal{Z}(\U(\Z G))$ have the same rank if $G$ is a finite group such that $\Q G$ has no epimorphic image which is either a non-commutative division algebra other than a totally definite quaternion algebra, or a two-by-two matrix algebra over a division algebra with center either the rationals or a quadratic imaginary extension of $\Q$. This allows us to prove that in this case the natural images of the Bass units of $\Z G$ generate a subgroup of finite index in $\U(\Z G)/\U(\Z G)'$."
"Adams operations are the natural transformations of the representation ring functor on the category of finite groups, and they are one way to describe the usual lambda-ring structure on these rings. From the representation-theoretical point of view, they codify some of the symmetric monoidal structure of the representation category. We show that the monoidal structure on the category alone, regardless of the particular symmetry, determines all the odd Adams operations. On the other hand, we give examples to show that monoidal equivalences do not have to preserve the second Adams operations and to show that monoidal equivalences that preserve the second Adams operations do not have to be symmetric. Along the way, we classify all possible symmetries and all monoidal autoequivalences of representation categories of finite groups."
"Let A be a commutative ring, and let \a be a weakly proregular ideal in A. (If A is noetherian then any ideal in it is weakly proregular.) Suppose M is a compact generator of the category of cohomologically \a-torsion complexes. We prove that the derived double centralizer of M is isomorphic to the \a-adic completion of A. The proof relies on the MGM equivalence from [PSY] and on derived Morita equivalence. Our result extends earlier work of Dwyer-Greenlees-Iyengar [DGI] and Efimov [Ef]."
"In nature, one observes that a K-theory of an object is defined in two steps. First a ""structured"" category is associated to the object. Second, a K-theory machine is applied to the latter category to produce an infinite loop space. We develop a general framework that deals with the first step of this process. The K-theory of an object is defined via a category of ""locally trivial"" objects with respect to a pretopology. We study conditions ensuring an exact structure on such categories. We also consider morphisms in K-theory that such contexts naturally provide. We end by defining various K-theories of schemes and morphisms between them."
"In this paper we introduce a new approach to determinant functors which allows us to extend Deligne's determinant functors for exact categories to Waldhausen categories, (strongly) triangulated categories, and derivators. We construct universal determinant functors in all cases by original methods which are interesting even for the known cases. Moreover, we show that the target of each universal determinant functor computes the corresponding $K$-theory in dimensions 0 and 1. As applications, we answer open questions by Maltsiniotis and Neeman on the $K$-theory of (strongly) triangulated categories and a question of Grothendieck to Knudsen on determinant functors. We also prove additivity theorems for low-dimensional $K$-theory and obtain generators and (some) relations for various $K_{1}$-groups."
"The aim of this note is to point out that Chern characters can be computed using curvatures o ``super-connections up to homotopy'. We also present an application to the vanishing theorem for Lie algebroids which is at the origin of new secondary classes of algebroids (Fernandes), hence, in particular, of Poisson manifolds."
"In this paper we show that the six functor formalism for sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff topological spaces, as developed for example in Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds, can be extended to sheaves with values in any closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category which is stable and bicomplete. Notice that, since we do not assume that our coefficients are presentable or restrict to hypercomplete sheaves, our arguments are not obvious and are substantially different from the ones explained by Kashiwara and Schapira. Along the way we also study locally contractible geometric morphisms and prove that, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map which induces a locally contractible geometric morphism, then the exceptional pullback functor $f^!$ preserves colimits and can be related to the pullback $f^*$. At the end of our paper we also show how one can express Atiyah duality by means of the six functor formalism."
"We give a new construction, based on categorical logic, of Nori's $\mathbb Q$-linear abelian category of mixed motives associated to a cohomology or homology functor with values in finite-dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb Q$. This new construction makes sense for infinite-dimensional vector spaces as well, so that it associates a $\mathbb Q$-linear abelian category of mixed motives to any (co)homology functor, not only Betti homology (as Nori had done) but also, for instance, $\ell$-adic, $p$-adic or motivic cohomology. We prove that the $\mathbb Q$-linear abelian categories of mixed motives associated to different (co)homology functors are equivalent if and only a family (of logical nature) of explicit properties is shared by these different functors. The problem of the existence of a universal cohomology theory and of the equivalence of the information encoded by the different classical cohomology functors thus reduces to that of checking these explicit conditions."
"We present a research programme aimed at constructing classifying toposes of Weil-type cohomology theories and associated categories of motives, and introduce a number of notions and preliminary results already obtained in this direction. In order to analyze the properties of Weil-type cohomology theories and their relations, we propose a framework based on atomic two-valued toposes and homogeneous models. Lastly, we construct a syntactic triangulated category whose dual maps to the derived categories of all the usual cohomology theories."
"Considering a (co)homology theory $\mathbb{T}$ on a base category $\mathcal{C}$ as a fragment of a first-order logical theory we here construct an abelian category $\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}]$ which is universal with respect to models of $\mathbb{T}$ in abelian categories. Under mild conditions on the base category $\mathcal{C}$, e.g. for the category of algebraic schemes, we get a functor from $\mathcal{C}$ to ${\rm Ch}({\rm Ind}(\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}]))$ the category of chain complexes of ind-objects of $\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}]$. This functor lifts Nori's motivic functor for algebraic schemes defined over a subfield of the complex numbers. Furthermore, we construct a triangulated functor from $D({\rm Ind}(\mathcal{A}[\mathbb{T}]))$ to Voevodsky's motivic complexes."
"Making use of Freyd's free abelian category on a preadditive category we show that if $T:D\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is a representation of a quiver $D$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ then there is an abelian category $\mathcal{A} (T)$, a faithful exact functor $F_T: \mathcal{A} (T) \to \mathcal{A}$ and an induced representation $\tilde T: D \to \mathcal{A} (T)$ such that $F_T\tilde T= T$ universally. We then can show that $\mathbb{T}$-motives as well as Nori's motives are given by a certain category of functors on definable categories."
"In this paper, we find at the properties of the family lambda which imply that the function space C(X,R^alpha) with the lambda-open topology is a semitopological group (paratopological group, topological group, topological vector space and other algebraic structures) under the usual operations of addition and multiplication (and multiplication by scalars)."
We show that once-extended anomalous 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories valued in the 2-category of k-linear categories are in canonical bijection with modular tensor categories equipped with a square root of the global dimension in each factor.
"This survey provides an elementary introduction to operads and to their applications in homotopical algebra. The aim is to explain how the notion of an operad was prompted by the necessity to have an algebraic object which encodes higher homotopies. We try to show how universal this theory is by giving many applications in Algebra, Geometry, Topology, and Mathematical Physics. (This text is accessible to any student knowing what tensor products, chain complexes, and categories are.)"
"In the paper, a method of describing the outer derivations of the group algebra of a finitely presentable group is given. The description of derivations is given in terms of characters of the groupoid of the adjoint action of the group."
"We apply the Auslander-Buchweitz approximation theory to show that the Iyama and Yoshino's subfactor triangulated category can be realized as a triangulated quotient. Applications of this realization go in three directions. Firstly, we recover both a result of Iyama and Yang and a result of the third author. Secondly, we extend the classical Buchweitz's triangle equivalence from Iwanaga-Gorenstein rings to Noetherian rings. Finally, we obtain the converse of Buchweitz's triangle equivalence and a result of Beligiannis, and give characterizations for Iwanaga-Gorenstein rings and Gorenstein algebras"
"We show that if the cochain complex computing Ext groups (in the category of modules over Hopf algebroids) admits a cocyclic structure, then the noncommutative Cartan calculus structure on Tor over Ext dualises in a cyclic sense to a calculus on Coext over Cotor. More precisely, the cyclic duals of the chain resp. cochain spaces computing the two classical derived functors lead to complexes that compute the more exotic ones, giving a cyclic opposite module over an operad with multiplication that induce operations such as a Lie derivative, a cap product (or contraction), and a (cyclic) differential, along with higher homotopy operators defining a noncommutative Cartan calculus up to homotopy. In particular, this allows to recover the classical Cartan calculus from differential geometry or the Chevalley-Eilenberg calculus for Lie(-Rinehart) algebras without any finiteness conditions or the use of topological tensor products."
"We show that if an operad is at the same time a cosimplicial object such that the respective structure maps are compatible with the operadic composition in a natural way, then one obtains a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on cohomology, and if the operad is cyclic, even that of a BV algebra. In particular, if a cyclic opposite module over an operad with multiplication is itself a cyclic operad that meets the cosimplicial compatibility conditions, the cohomology of its cyclic dual turns into a BV algebra. This amounts to conditions for when the cyclic dual of a BV module is endowed with a BV algebra structure, a result we exemplify by looking at classical and less classical (co)homology groups in Hopf algebra theory."
"We show under what conditions the complex computing general Ext-groups carries the structure of a cyclic operad such that Ext becomes a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. This is achieved by transferring cyclic cohomology theories for the dual of a (left) Hopf algebroid to the complex in question, which asks for the notion of contramodules introduced along with comodules by Eilenberg-Moore half a century ago. Another crucial ingredient is an explicit formula for the inverse of the Hopf-Galois map on the dual, by which we illustrate recent categorical results and answer a long-standing open question. As an application, we prove that the Hochschild cohomology of an associative algebra A is Batalin-Vilkovisky if A itself is a contramodule over its enveloping algebra A \otimes A^op. This is, for example, the case for symmetric algebras and Frobenius algebras with semisimple Nakayama automorphism. We also recover the construction for Hopf algebras."
"We present a unifying approach to the study of entropies in Mathematics, such as measure entropy, topological entropy, algebraic entropy, set-theoretic entropy. We take into account discrete dynamical systems, that is, pairs $(X,T)$, where $X$ is the underlying space and $T:X\to X$ a transformation. We see entropies as functions $h:\mathfrak X\to \mathbb R_+$, associating to each flow $(X,T)$ of a category $\mathfrak X$ either a non negative real or $\infty$. We introduce the notion of semigroup entropy $h_\mathfrak S:\mathfrak S\to\mathbb R_+$, which is a numerical invariant attached to endomorphisms of the category $\mathfrak S$ of normed semigroups. Then, for a functor $F:\mathfrak X\to\mathfrak S$ from any specific category $\mathfrak X$ to $\mathfrak S$, we define the functorial entropy $h_F:\mathfrak X\to\mathbb R_+$ as the composition $h_{\mathfrak S}\circ F$. Clearly, $h_F$ inherits many of the properties of $h_\mathfrak S$, depending also on the properties of $F$. Such general scheme permits to obtain relevant known entropies as functorial entropies $h_F$, for appropriate categories $\mathfrak X$ and functors $F$, and to establish the properties shared by them. In this way we point out their common nature. Finally, we discuss and deeply analyze through the looking glass of our unifying approach the relations between pairs of entropies. To this end we formalize the notion of Bridge Theorem between two entropies $h_i:\mathfrak X_i\to \mathbb R_+$, $i=1,2$, with respect to a functor $\varepsilon:\mathfrak X_1\to\mathfrak X_2$. Then, for pairs of functorial entropies we use the above scheme to introduce the notion and the related scheme of Strong Bridge Theorem, which allows us to put under the same umbrella various relations between pairs of entropies."
"We use a landmark result in the theory of Riesz spaces - Freudenthal's 1936 Spectral Theorem - to canonically represent any Archimedean lattice-ordered group $G$ with a strong unit as a (non-separating) lattice-group of real valued continuous functions on an appropriate $G$-indexed zero-dimensional compactification $w_GZ_G$ of its space $Z_G$ of \emph{minimal} prime ideals. The two further ingredients needed to establish this representation are the Yosida representation of $G$ on its space $X_G$ of \emph{maximal} ideals, and the well-known continuous surjection of $Z_G$ onto $X_G$. We then establish our main result by showing that the inclusion-minimal extension of this representation of $G$ that separates the points of $Z_G$ - namely, the sublattice subgroup of ${\rm C}\,(Z_G)$ generated by the image of $G$ along with all characteristic functions of clopen (closed and open) subsets of $Z_G$ which are determined by elements of $G$ - is precisely the classical projectable hull of $G$. Our main result thus reveals a fundamental relationship between projectable hulls and minimal spectra, and provides the most direct and explicit construction of projectable hulls to date. Our techniques do require the presence of a strong unit."
"We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadratic polynomial to be irreducible in the ring $Z[[x]]$ of formal power series with integer coefficients. For $n,m\ge 1$ and $p$ prime, we show that $p^n+p^m\beta x+\alpha x^2$ is reducible in $Z[[x]]$ if and only if it is reducible in $Z_p[x]$, the ring of polynomials over the $p$-adic integers."
"We exhibit a bridge between the theory of cellular categories, used in algebraic topology and homological algebra, and the model-theoretic notion of stable independence. Roughly speaking, we show that the combinatorial cellular categories (those where, in a precise sense, the cellular morphisms are generated by a set) are exactly those that give rise to stable independence notions. We give two applications: on the one hand, we show that the abstract elementary classes of roots of Ext studied by Baldwin-Eklof-Trlifaj are stable and tame. On the other hand, we give a simpler proof (in a special case) that combinatorial categories are closed under 2-limits, a theorem of Makkai and Rosick\'y."
"We present a history of the Baum-Connes conjecture, the methods involved, the current status, and the mathematics it generated."
"This paper is motivated by the quest of a non-group irreducible finite index depth 2 maximal subfactor. We compute the generic fusion rules of the Grothendieck ring of Rep(PSL(2,q)), q prime-power, by applying a Verlinde-like formula on the generic character table. We then prove that this family of fusion rings R_q interpolates to all integers q>=2, providing (when q is not prime-power) the first example of infinite family of non group-like simple integral fusion rings. Furthermore, they pass all the known criteria of (unitary) categorification. This provides infinitely many serious candidates for solving the famous open problem of whether there exists an integral fusion category which is not weakly group-theoretical. We prove that a complex categorification (if any) of an interpolated fusion ring R_q (with q non prime-power) cannot be braided, and so its Drinfeld center must be simple. In general, this paper proves that a non-pointed simple fusion category is non-braided if and only if its Drinfeld center is simple; and also that every simple integral fusion category is weakly group-theoretical if and only if every simple integral modular fusion category is pointed."
"Hilbert's fourth problem asks for the construction and the study of metrics on subsets of projective space for which the projective line segments are geodesics. Several solutions of the problem were given so far, depending on more precise interpretations of this problem, with various additional conditions satisfied. The most interesting solutions are probably those inspired from an integral formula that was first introduced in this theory by Herbert Busemann. Besides that, Busemann and his school made a thorough investigation of metrics defined on subsets of projective space for which the projective lines are geodesics and they obtained several results, characterizing several classes of such metrics. We review some of the developments and important results related to Hilbert's problem, especially those that arose from Busemann's work, mentioning recent results and connections with several branches of mathematics, including Riemannian geometry, the foundations of mathematics, the calculus of variations, metric geometry and Finsler geometry."
"We explore the perspective of a bug living on the two-dimensional surface of a polyhedron. Images of various kinds of effects like lensing and cloaking are shown via color pictures of three viewpoints: the first person perspective of the bug, a map of the bug's viewpoint, and a look at the bug on the embedded polyhedron from a three-dimensional exterior viewer. The pictures were constructed by computing the exponential map of a polyhedron by cutting and rotating faces into the tangent plane of the bug."
"The prominent Russian mathematician Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich passed away on February 19, 2017. In this article we supply his biography, discuss his many important contributions to number theory, algebra and algebraic geometry, and also discuss his political activity and some of his numerous publications on social issues."
"In the first section we discuss Morita invariance of differentiable/algebroid cohomology.   In the second section we present an extension of the van Est isomorphism to groupoids. This immediately implies a version of Haefliger's conjecture for differentiable cohomology.   As a first application we clarify the connection between differentiable and algebroid cohomology (proved in degree 1, and conjectured in degree 2 by Weinstein-Xu).   As a second application we extend van Est's argument for the integrability of Lie algebras. Applied to Poisson manifolds, this immediately gives (a slight improvement of) Hector-Dazord's integrability criterion.   In the third section we describe the relevant characteristic classes of representations, living in algebroid cohomology, as well as their relation to the van Est map. This extends Evens-Lu-Weinstein's characteristic class $\theta_{L}$ (hence, in particular, the modular class of Poisson manifolds), and also the classical characteristic classes of flat vector bundles.   In the last section we describe some applications to Poisson geometry (e.g. we clarify the Morita invariance of Poisson cohomology, and of the modular class)."
"In this note we clarify the relevance of ``connections up to homotopy'' to the theory of characteristic classes. We have already remarked \cite{Crai} that such connections up to homotopy can be used to compute the classical Chern characters. Here we present a slightly different argument for this, and then proceed with the discussion of the flat (secondary) characteristic classes. As an application, we clarify the relation between the two different approaches to characteristic classes of algebroids (and of Poisson manifolds in particular): we explain that the intrinsic characteristic classes are precisely the secondary classes of the adjoint representation."
"In this paper we investigate generalizations of Kazhdan's property $(T)$ to the setting of uniformly convex Banach spaces. We explain the interplay between the existence of spectral gaps and that of Kazhdan projections. Our methods employ Markov operators associated to a random walk on the group, for which we provide new norm estimates and convergence results. They exhibit useful properties and flexibility, and allow to view Kazhdan projections in Banach spaces as natural objects associated to random walks on groups.   We give a number of applications of these results. In particular, we address several open questions. We give a direct comparison of properties $(TE)$ and $FE$ with Lafforgue's reinforced Banach property $(T)$; we obtain shrinking target theorems for orbits of Kazhdan groups; finally, answering a question of Willett and Yu we construct non-compact ghost projections for warped cones. In this last case we conjecture that such warped cones provide counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture."
"A celebrated and deep result of Green and Tao states that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In this note I provide a straightforward argument demonstrating that the primes get arbitrarily close to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. The argument also applies to `large sets' in the sense of Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an. The proof is short, completely self-contained, and aims to give a heuristic explanation of why the primes, and other large sets, possess arithmetic structure."
"It is shown that the ring of periodic distributions is a coherent ring (with the operations of pointwise addition and convolution) by showing that the isomorphic ring $s'$ of the Fourier coefficients (of sequences of at most polynomial growth) with termwise operations is coherent. Moreover, it is shown that the subring $\ell^\infty$ of $s'$ of all bounded sequences is coherent too, while the subring $c$ of $\ell^\infty$ of all convergent sequences is not coherent. It is also observed that $s'$ is a Hermite ring, but not a projective free ring."
"For n at least 2, the concept of n-way expanders was defined by various researchers. Bigger n gives a weaker notion in general, and 2-way expanders coincide with expanders in usual sense. Koji Fujiwara asked whether these concepts are equivalent to that of ordinary expanders for all n for a sequence of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we answer his question in the affirmative. Furthermore, we obtain universal inequalities on multi-way isoperimetric constants on any finite connected vertex-transitive graph, and show that gaps between these constants imply the imprimitivity of the group action on the graph."
"Magnitude homology is an invariant of enriched categories which generalizes ordinary categorical homology -- the homology of the classifying space of a small category. The classifying space can also be generalized in a different direction: it extends from categories to bicategories as the geometric realization of the geometric nerve. This paper introduces a hybrid of the two ideas: an iterated magnitude homology theory for categories with a second- or higher-order enrichment. This encompasses, for example, groups equipped with extra structure such as a partial ordering or a bi-invariant metric. In the case of a strict 2-category, iterated magnitude homology recovers the homology of the classifying space; we investigate its content and behaviour when interpreted for partially ordered groups, normed groups, and strict $n$-categories for $n > 2$."
"Inspired by recent works on rings satisfying Auslander's conjecture, we study invariants, which we call Auslander bounds, and prove that they have strong relations to some homological conjectures."
"We show that a differential module is Gorenstein projective if and only if its underlying module is Gorenstein projective. Dually, a differential module is Gorenstein injective if and only if its underlying module is Gorenstein injective."
"In this paper we describe an inductive machinery to investigate asymptotic behaviors of homology groups and related invariants of representations of certain graded combinatorial categories over a commutative Noetherian ring $k$, via introducing inductive functors which generalize important properties of shift functors of $\mathrm{FI}$-modules. In particular, a sufficient criterion for finiteness of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of finitely generated representations of these categories is obtained. As applications, we show that a few important infinite combinatorial categories appearing in representation stability theory are equipped with inductive functors, and hence the finiteness of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of their finitely generated representations is guaranteed. We also prove that truncated representations of these categories have linear minimal resolutions by relative projective modules, which are precisely linear minimal projective resolutions when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0."
"Let $B\subset A$ be a left or right bounded extension of finite dimensional algebras. We use the Jacobi-Zariski long nearly exact sequence to show that $B$ satisfies Han's conjecture if and only if $A$ does, regardless if the extension splits or not. We provide conditions ensuring that an extension by arrows and relations is left or right bounded. Finally we give a structure result for extensions of an algebra given by a quiver and admissible relations, and examples of non split left or right bounded extensions."
"Recantly, William Crawley-Boevey proposed the definition of a Poisson structure on a noncommutative algebra $A$ based on the Kontsevich principle. His idea was to find the {\it weakest} possible structure on $A$ that induces standard (commutative) Poisson structures on all representation spaces $ \Rep_V(A) $. It turns out that such a weak Poisson structure on $A$ is a Lie algebra bracket on the 0-th cyclic homology $ \HC_0(A) $ satisfying some extra conditions; it was thus called in an {\it $ H_0$-Poisson structure}.   This paper studies a higher homological extension of this construction. In our more general setting, we show that noncommutative Poisson structures in the above sense behave nicely with respect to homotopy (in the sense that homotopy equivalent NC Poisson structures on $A$ induce (via the derived representation functor) homotopy equivalent Poisson algebra structures on the derved representation schemes $\DRep_V(A) $). For an ordinary algebra $A$, a noncommutative Poisson structure on a semifree (more generally, cofibrant) resolution of $A$ yields a graded (super) Lie algebra structure on the full cyclic homology $ \HC_\bullet(A) $ extending Crawley-Boevey's $\H_0$-Poisson structure on $ \HC_0(A) $. We call such structures {\it derived Poisson structures} on $A$.   We also show that derived Poisson structures do arise in nature: the cobar construction $\Omega(C)$ of an $(-n)$-cyclic coassociative DG coalgebra (in particular, of the linear dual of a finite dimensional $n$-cyclic DG algebra) $C$ carries a $(2-n)$-double Poisson bracket in the sense of Van den Bergh. This in turn induces a corresponding noncommutative $(2-n)$-Poisson structure on $\Omega(C)$. When (the semifree) DG algebra $\Omega(C)$ resolves an honest algebra $A$, $A$ acquires a derived $(2-n)$-Poisson structure."
"The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces is a basic result of functional analysis with far-reaching consequences. We introduce an equational logic $\vDash_{\Delta}$ associated with an infinitary variety $\Delta$ and show that the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem is a consequence of the Beth definability property of $\vDash_{\Delta}$, stating that every implicit definition can be made explicit. Further, we define an infinitary propositional logic $\vdash_{\Delta}$ by means of a Hilbert-style calculus and prove a strong completeness result whereby the semantic notion of consequence associated with $\vdash_{\Delta}$ coincides with $\vDash_{\Delta}$."
"This is an expository article that results from a talk given to second year students at Oldenburg university. The aim of the talk was to show what beautiful and unexpected results may be obtained if one plays with daring analogies in a way that is usually not done in undergraduate education (unfortunately): We start from the fact that the sum of diagonal entries of a symmetric matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues. We then guess an analogous formula where the matrix is replaced by a function of two real variables and sums are replaced by integrals in a systematic way. We show that this is indeed a worthwhile process: In a special case it yields that the sum of inverse squares of the positive integers is pi^2/6. Finally, an outline of the proof of the guessed formula is given, and further applications, for example to the connection between billiards and the frequencies of a drum, are explained."
"One can build an operatorial model for freeness by considering either the right-handed or the left-handed representation of algebras of operators acting on the free product of the underlying pointed Hilbert spaces. Considering both at the same time, that is, computing distributions of operators in the algebra generated by the left- and right-handed representations, led Voiculescu in 2013 to define and study bifreeness and, in the sequel, triggered the development of an extension of noncommutative probability now frequently referred to as multi-faced (two-faced in the example given above). Many examples of two-faced independences emerged these past years. Of great interest to us are biBoolean, bifree and type I bimonotone independences. In this paper, we extend the preLie calculus pertaining to free, Boolean, and monotone moment-cumulant relations initiated by K. Ebrahimi-Fard and F. Patras to their above-mentioned two-faced equivalents."
"We write $\mathbb P$ for the polynomial algebra in one variable over the finite field $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb P^{\otimes t} = \mathbb Z_2[x_1, \ldots, x_t]$ for its $t$-fold tensor product with itself. We grade $\mathbb P^{\otimes t}$ by assigning degree $1$ to each generator. We are interested in determining a minimal set of generators for the ring of invariants $(\mathbb P^{\otimes t})^{G_t}$ as a module over Steenrod ring, $\mathscr A_2.$ Here $G_t$ is a subgroup of the general linear group $GL(t, \mathbb Z_2).$ An equivalent problem is to find a monomial basis of the space of ""unhit"" elements, $\mathbb Z_2\otimes_{\mathscr A_2} (\mathbb P^{\otimes t})^{G_t}$ in each $t$ and degree $n\geq 0.$ The structure of this tensor product is proved surprisingly difficult and has been not yet known for $t\geq 5,$ even for the trivial subgroup $G_t = \{e\}.$ In the present paper, we consider the subgroup $G_t = \{e\}$ for $t \in \{5, 6\},$ and obtain some new results on $\mathscr A_2$-generators of $(\mathbb P^{\otimes t})^{G_t}$ in some degrees. At the same time, some of their applications have been proposed. We also provide an algorithm in MAGMA for verifying the results. This study can be understood as a continuation of our recent works in [23, 25]."
"An equivariant Thom isomorphism theorem in operator K-theory is formulated and proven for infinite rank Euclidean vector bundles over finite dimensional Riemannian manifolds. The main ingredient in the argument is the construction of a non-commutative C*-algebra associated to a bundle E -> M, equipped with a compatible connection, which plays the role of the algebra of functions on the infinite dimensional total space E. If the base M is a point, we obtain the Bott periodicity isomorphism theorem of Higson-Kasparov-Trout for infinite dimensional Euclidean spaces. The construction applied to an even (finite rank) spin-c-bundle over an even-dimensional proper spin-c-manifold reduces to the classical Thom isomorphism in topological K-theory. The techniques involve non-commutative geometric functional analysis."
"Let M be a smooth Fredholm manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional Euclidean space E with Riemannian metric g. Given an (augmented) Fredholm filtration F of M by finite-dimensional submanifolds (M_n), we associate to the triple (M, g, F) a non-commutative direct limit C*-algebra A(M, g, F) = lim A(M_n) that can play the role of the algebra of functions vanishing at infinity on the non-locally compact space M. The C*-algebra A(E), as constructed by Higson-Kasparov-Trout for their Bott periodicity theorem for infinite dimensional Euclidean spaces, is isomorphic to our construction when M = E. If M has an oriented Spin_q-structure (1 <= q <=\infty), then the K-theory of this C*-algebra is the same (with dimension shift) as the topological K-theory of M defined by Mukherjea. Furthermore, there is a Poincare' duality isomorphism of this K-theory of M with the compactly supported K-homology of M, just as in the finite-dimensional spin setting."
"We develop elliptic regularity theory for Dirac operators in a very general framework: we consider Dirac operators linear over $C^*$-algebras, on noncompact manifolds, and in families which are not necessarily locally trivial fibre bundles."
"Keller introduced a notion of quotient of a differential graded category modulo a full differential graded subcategory which agrees with Verdier's notion of quotient of a triangulated category modulo a triangulated subcategory. This work is an attempt to further develop his theory.   More than a half of the text is devoted to an overview of ""well known"" definitions and results. As a result, the e-print is essentially self-contained."
"It is now well known that the K-theory of a Waldhausen category depends on more than just its (triangulated) homotopy category (see [Schlichting]). The purpose of this note is to show that the K-theory spectrum of a (good) Waldhausen category is completely determined by its Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization, without any additional structure. As the simplicial localization is a refined version of the homotopy category which also determines the triangulated structure, our result is a possible answer to the general question: ``To which extent $K$-theory is not an invariant of triangulated derived categories ?''"
"We study the Hochschild homology of smooth spaces, emphasizing the importance of a pairing which generalizes Mukai's pairing on the cohomology of K3 surfaces. We show that integral transforms between derived categories of spaces induce, functorially, linear maps on homology. Adjoint functors induce adjoint linear maps with respect to the Mukai pairing. We define a Chern character with values in Hochschild homology, and we discuss analogues of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem and the Cardy Condition from physics. This is done in the context of a 2-category which has spaces as its objects and integral kernels as its 1-morphisms."
"In this paper we study the question of how to transfer homotopic structure from the category sD of simplicial objects in a fixed category D to D. To this end we use a sort of homotopy colimit s : sD --> D, which we call simple functor. For instance, the Bousfield-Kan homotopy colimit in a Quillen simplicial model category is an example of simple functor. As a remarkable example outside the setting of Quillen models we include Deligne simple of mixed Hodge complexes. We prove here that the simple functor induces an equivalence on the corresponding localized categories. We also describe a natural structure of Brown category of cofibrant objects on sD. We use these facts to produce cofiber sequences on the localized category of D by E, which give rise to a natural Verdier triangulated structure in the stable case."
"In this paper we prove that for any model category, the Bousfield-Kan construction of the homotopy colimit is the absolute left derived functor of the colimit. This is achieved by showing that the Bousfield-Kan homotopy colimit is moreover a realizable homotopy colimit, defined by means of a suitable 2-category of relative categories. In addition, in the case of exact coproducts, we characterize the realizable homotopy colimits that satisfy a cofinality property as those given by a formula following the pattern of Bousfield-Kan construction: they are the composition of a ""geometric realization"" with the simplicial replacement."
"Recall that the definition of the $K$-theory of an object C (e.g., a ring or a space) has the following pattern. One first associates to the object C a category A_C that has a suitable structure (exact, Waldhausen, symmetric monoidal, ...). One then applies to the category A_C a ""$K$-theory machine"", which provides an infinite loop space that is the $K$-theory K(C) of the object C.   We study the first step of this process. What are the kinds of objects to be studied via $K$-theory? Given these types of objects, what structured categories should one associate to an object to obtain $K$-theoretic information about it? And how should the morphisms of these objects interact with this correspondence?   We propose a unified, conceptual framework for a number of important examples of objects studied in $K$-theory. The structured categories associated to an object C are typically categories of modules in a monoidal (op-)fibred category. The modules considered are ""locally trivial"" with respect to a given class of trivial modules and a given Grothendieck topology on the object C's category."
"In this paper we introduce a derivability criterion of functors based on the existence of adjunctions rather than on the existence of resolutions. It constitutes a converse of Quillen-Maltsiniotis Derived Adjunction Theorem. We present two consequences of our derivability criterion. On the one hand, we prove that the two notions for homotopy colimits corresponding to Grothendieck derivators and Quillen model categories are equivalent. On the other hand, we deduce that the internal hom for derived Morita theory constructed by B. Toen is indeed the right derived functor of the internal hom of dg-categories."
"The main objective of this paper is to propose a definition of non-connective K-theory for a wide class of relative exact categories which, in general, do not satisfy the factorization axiom and confirm that it agrees with the non-connective K-theory for exact categories and complicial exact categories with weak equivalences. The main application is to study the topological filtrations of non-connective K-theory of a noetherian commutative ring with unit in terms of Koszul cubes."
We introduce a delooping model of relative exact categories. It gives us a condition that the negative K-group of a relative exact category becomes trivial.
"We provide conditions on a monoidal model category $\mathcal{M}$ so that the category of commutative monoids in $\mathcal{M}$ inherits a model structure from $\mathcal{M}$ in which a map is a weak equivalence or fibration if and only if it is so in $\mathcal{M}$. We then investigate properties of cofibrations of commutative monoids, rectification between $E_\infty$-algebras and commutative monoids, the relationship between commutative monoids and monoidal Bousfield localization functors, when the category of commutative monoids can be made left proper, and functoriality of the passage from a commutative monoid $R$ to the category of commutative $R$-algebras. In the final section we provide numerous examples of model categories satisfying our hypotheses."
"Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a combinatorial and left proper model category, possibly with a monoidal structure. If $\mathscr{O}$ is either a monad on $\mathscr{M}$ or an operad enriched over $\mathscr{M}$, define a QS-algebra in $\mathscr{M}$ to be a weak equivalence $\mathscr{F}: s(\mathscr{F}) \xrightarrow{\sim}t(\mathscr{F})$ such that the target $t(\mathscr{F})$ is an $\mathscr{O}$-algebra in the usual sense. A classical $\mathscr{O}$-algebra is a QS-algebra supported by an isomorphism $\mathscr{F}$. A QS-structure $\mathscr{F}$ is also a weak equivalence such that $t(\mathscr{F})$ has a structure, e.g, Hodge, twistorial, schematic, sheaf, etc. We build a homotopy theory of these objects and compare it with that of usual $\mathscr{O}$-algebras/structures. Our results rely on Smith's theorem on left Bousfield localization for combinatorial and left proper model categories. These ideas are derived from the theory of co-Segal algebras and categories."
"If $\mathscr{M}$ is a model category and $\mathcal{U}: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{M}$ is a functor, we defined a Quillen-Segal $\mathcal{U}$-object as a weak equivalence $\mathscr{F}: s(\mathscr{F}) \xrightarrow{\sim} t(\mathscr{F})$ such that $t(\mathscr{F})=\mathcal{U}(b)$ for some $b\in \mathscr{A}$. If $\mathcal{U}$ is the nerve functor $\mathcal{U}: \mathbf{Cat} \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_J$, with the Joyal model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$, then studying the comma category $(\mathbf{sSet}_J \downarrow \mathcal{U})$ leads naturally to concepts, such as Lurie's $\infty$-operad. It also gives simple examples of presentable, stable $\infty$-category, and higher topos. If we consider the \textit{coherent nerve} $\mathcal{U}: \mathbf{sCat}_B \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_J$, then the theory of QS-objects directly connects with the program of Riehl and Verity. If we apply our main result when $\mathcal{U}$ is the identity $Id: \mathbf{sSet}_Q \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}_Q$, with the Quillen model structure, the homotopy theory of QS-objects is equivalent to that of Kan complexes and we believe that this is an \textit{avatar} of Voevodsky's \textit{Univalence axiom}. This equivalence holds for any combinatorial and left proper $\mathscr{M}$. This result agrees with our intuition, since by essence the `\textit{Quillen-Segal type}' is the \textit{Equivalence type}"
"For equivariant stable homotopy theory, equivariant KK-theory and equivariant derived categories, we show how restriction to a subgroup of finite index yields a finite commutative separable extension, analogous to finite \'etale extensions in algebraic geometry."
"We associate to a bimonoidal functor, i.e. a bifunctor which is monoidal in each variable, a nonabelian version of a biextension. We show that such a biextension satisfies additional triviality conditions which make it a bilinear analog of the kind of spans known as butterflies and, conversely, these data determine a bimonoidal functor. We extend this result to $n$-variables, and prove that, in a manner analogous to that of butterflies, these multi-extensions can be composed. This is phrased in terms of a multilinear functor calculus in a bicategory. As an application, we study a bimonoidal category or stack, treating the multiplicative structure as a bimonoidal functor with respect to the additive one. In the context of the multilinear functor calculus, we view the bimonoidal structure as an instance of the general notion of pseudo-monoid. We show that when the structure is ring-like, i.e. the pseudo-monoid is a stack whose fibers are categorical rings, we can recover the classification by the third Mac Lane cohomology of a ring with values in a bimodule."
"We show that $\mathit{ann}$-categories admit a presentation by crossed bimodules, and prove that morphisms between them can be expressed by special kinds spans between the presentations. More precisely, we prove the groupoid of morphisms between two $\mathit{ann}$-categories is equivalent to that of bimodule butterflies between the presentations. A bimodule butterfly is a specialization of a butterfly, i.e. a special kind of span or fraction, between the underlying complexes"
"Let X be a smooth projective variety. Using the idea of brane actions discovered by To\""en, we construct a lax associative action of the operad of stable curves of genus zero on the variety X seen as an object in correspondences in derived stacks. This action encodes the Gromov-Witten theory of X in purely geometrical terms and induces an action on the derived category Qcoh(X) which allows us to recover the Quantum K-theory of Givental-Lee."
"We show how to induce products in sheaf cohomology for a wide variety of coefficients: sheaves of dg commutative and Lie algebras, symmetric Omega-spectra, filtered dg algebras, operads and operad algebras."
"Stratifolds are considered from a categorical point of view. We show among others that the category of stratifolds fully faithfully embeds into the category of ${\mathbb R}$-algebras as does the category of smooth manifolds. We prove that a variant of the Serre-Swan theorem holds for stratifolds. In particular, the category of vector bundles over a stratifold is shown to be equivalent to the category of vector bundles over an associated affine scheme although the latter is in general larger than the stratifold itself."
"This paper provides a homotopical version of the adjoint lifting theorem in category theory, allowing for Quillen equivalences to be lifted from monoidal model categories to categories of algebras over colored operads. The generality of our approach allows us to simultaneously answer questions of rectification and of changing the base model category to a Quillen equivalent one. We work in the setting of colored operads, and we do not require them to be $\Sigma$-cofibrant. Special cases of our main theorem recover many known results regarding rectification and change of model category, as well as numerous new results. In particular, we recover a recent result of Richter-Shipley about a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between commutative $H\mathbb{Q}$-algebra spectra and commutative differential graded $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras, but our version involves only three Quillen equivalences instead of six. We also work out the theory of how to lift Quillen equivalences to categories of colored operad algebras after a left Bousfield localization."
"The paper contains a collection of results related to weight structures, $t$-structures, and (more generally) to torsion pairs. For any weight structure $w$ we study (co)homological pure functors; these ""ignore all weights except weight zero"" and have already found several applications. We also study virtual $t$-truncations of cohomological functors coming from $w$. These are closely related to $t$-structures; so we prove in several cases (including certain categories of coherent sheaves) that $w$ ""gives"" a $t$-structure (that is adjacent or $\Phi$-orthogonal to it). We also study in detail ""well generated"" weight structures (and prove that any perfect set of objects generates a weight structure). The existence of weight structures right adjacent to compactly generated $t$-structures (and constructed using Brown-Comenetz duality) implies that the hearts of the latter have injective cogenerators and satisfy the AB3* axiom; actually, ""most of them"" are Grothendieck abelian (due to the existence of ""regularly orthogonal"" weight structures).   It is convenient for us to use the notion of torsion pairs; these essentially generalize both weight structures and $t$-structures. We prove several properties of torsion pairs (that are rather parallel to that of weight structures); we also generalize a theorem of D. Pospisil and J. Stovicek to obtain a classification of compactly generated torsion pairs."
"We prove that the arrow category of a monoidal model category, equipped with the pushout product monoidal structure and the projective model structure, is a monoidal model category. This answers a question posed by Mark Hovey, and has the important consequence that it allows for the consideration of a monoidal product in cubical homotopy theory. As illustrations we include numerous examples of non-cofibrantly generated monoidal model categories, including chain complexes, small categories, topological spaces, and pro-categories."
"Building upon Hovey's work on Smith ideals for monoids, we develop a homotopy theory of Smith ideals for general operads in a symmetric monoidal category. For a sufficiently nice stable monoidal model category and an operad satisfying a cofibrancy condition, we show that there is a Quillen equivalence between a model structure on Smith ideals and a model structure on algebra maps induced by the cokernel and the kernel. For symmetric spectra, this applies to the commutative operad and all Sigma-cofibrant operads. For chain complexes over a field of characteristic zero and the stable module category, this Quillen equivalence holds for all operads. This paper ends with a comparison between the semi-model category approach and the $\infty$-category approach to encoding the homotopy theory of algebras over Sigma-cofibrant operads that are not necessarily admissible."
"In this paper we prove a categorification of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem. Our result implies in particular a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for To\""en and Vezzosi's secondary Chern character. As a main application, we establish a comparison between the To\""en-Vezzosi Chern character and the classical Chern character, and show that the categorified Chern character recovers the classical de Rham realization."
"This dissertation comprises three collections of results, all united by a common theme. The theme is the study of categories via algebraic techniques, considering categories themselves as algebraic objects. This algebraic approach to category theory is central to noncommutative algebraic geometry, as realized by recent advances in the study of noncommutative motives.   We have success proving algebraic results in the general setting of symmetric monoidal and semiring $\infty$-categories, which categorify abelian groups and rings, respectively. For example, we prove that modules over the semiring category Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\infty$-categories, and modules over Burn (the Burnside $\infty$-category) are additive $\infty$-categories.   As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic $\text{Fin}^\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher categorical study of Lawvere theories. We prove that Lawvere theories function as a home for an algebraic Yoneda lemma.   Finally, we provide evidence for a formal duality between naive and genuine equivariant homotopy theory, in the form of a group-theoretic Eilenberg-Watts Theorem. This sets up a parallel between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory, where Burnside constructions are analogous to Morita theory. We conjecture that this relationship could be made precise within the context of noncommutative motives over the field with one element."
"An alternative approach to the classical Morel-Voevodsky stable motivic homotopy theory $SH(k)$ is suggested. The triangulated category of framed bispectra $SH_{nis}^{fr}(k)$ and effective framed bispectra $SH_{nis}^{fr,eff}(k)$ are introduced in the paper. Both triangulated categories only use Nisnevich local equivalences and have nothing to do with any kind of motivic equivalences. It is shown that $SH_{nis}^{fr}(k)$ and $SH_{nis}^{fr,eff}(k)$ recover the classical Morel-Voevodsky triangulated categories of bispectra $SH(k)$ and effective bispectra $SH^{eff}(k)$ respectively.   We also recover $SH(k)$ and $SH^{eff}(k)$ as the triangulated category of framed motivic spectral functors $SH_{S^1}^{fr}[\mathcal Fr_0(k)]$ and the triangulated category of framed motives $\mathcal {SH}^{fr}(k)$ respectively constructed in the paper."
"For each prime $p$, we define a $t$-structure on the category $\widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}_{harm}^b$ of harmonic $\mathbb{C}$-motivic left module spectra over $\widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau$, whose MGL-homology has bounded Chow-Novikov degree, such that its heart is equivalent to the abelian category of $p$-completed $BP_*BP$-comodules that are concentrated in even degrees. We prove that $\widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}_{harm}^b$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}^b({{BP}_*{BP}\text{-}\mathbf{Comod}}^{{ev}})$ as stable $\infty$-categories equipped with $t$-structures.   As an application, for each prime $p$, we prove that the motivic Adams spectral sequence for $\widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau$, which converges to the motivic homotopy groups of $\widehat{S^{0,0}}/\tau$, is isomorphic to the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence, which converges to the classical Adams-Novikov $E_2$-page for the sphere spectrum $\widehat{S^0}$. This isomorphism of spectral sequences allows Isaksen and the second and third authors to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres at least to the 90-stem, with ongoing computations into even higher dimensions."
"This paper is dedicated to the study of weight complexes (defined on triangulated categories endowed with weight structures) and their applications. We introduce pure (co)homological functors that ""ignore all non-zero weights""; these have a nice description in terms of weight complexes. For the weight structure $w^G$ generated by the orbit category in the $G$-equivariant stable homotopy category $SH(G)$ the corresponding pure cohomological functors into abelian groups are the Bredon cohomology associated to Mackey functors ones; pure functors related to motivic weight structures are also quite useful.   Our results also give some (more) new weight structures. Moreover, we prove that certain exact functors are conservative and ""detect weights""."
"This paper gives an introduction to homotopy descent, and its applications in algebraic $K$-theory computations for fields. On the \'etale site of a field, a fibrant model of a simplicial presheaf can be constructed from naive Galois cohomological objects given by homotopy fixed point constructions, but only up to pro-equivalence. The homotopy fixed point spaces define finite Galois descent for simplicial presheaves (and their relatives) over a field, but a pro-categorical construction is a necessary second step for passage from finite descent conditions to full homotopy descent in a Galois cohomological setting."
"We flesh out the theory of ""trace theories"" and ""trace functors"" sketched in arXiv:1308.3743, extend it to a homotopical setting, and prove a reconstruction theorem claiming that a trace theory is completely determined by the associated trace functor. As an application, we consider Topological Hoshschild Homology $THH(A,M)$ of a algebra $A$ over a perfect field of positive characteristic, with coefficients in a bimodule $M$, and prove two comparison results. Firstly, we give a very simple algebraic model for THH in terms of Hochschild-Witt Homology WHH of arXiv:1604.01588 (and we also identify $TP(A)$ with the periodic version $WHP(A)$ of WHH). Secondly, we prove that $THH(A)$ is identified with the zero term of the conjugate filtration on the co-periodic cyclic homology $\overline{HP}(A)$ of arXiv:1509.08784, and the isomorphism sends the Bokstedt periodicity generator to the Bott periodicity generator. We also give an independent proof of Bokstedt periodicity that is somewhat shorter than the usual ones."
"We compute the spectrum of the category of derived Mackey functors (in the sense of Kaledin) for all finite groups. We find that this space captures precisely the top and bottom layers (i.e. the height infinity and height zero parts) of the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy category. Due to this truncation of the chromatic information, we are able to obtain a complete description of the spectrum for all finite groups, despite our incomplete knowledge of the topology of the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy category. From a different point of view, we show that the spectrum of derived Mackey functors can be understood as the space obtained from the spectrum of the Burnside ring by ""ungluing"" closed points. In order to compute the spectrum, we provide a new description of Kaledin's category, as the derived category of an equivariant ring spectrum, which may be of independent interest. In fact, we clarify the relationship between several different categories, establishing symmetric monoidal equivalences and comparisons between the constructions of Kaledin, the spectral Mackey functors of Barwick, the ordinary derived category of Mackey functors, and categories of modules over certain equivariant ring spectra. We also illustrate an interesting feature of the ordinary derived category of Mackey functors that distinguishes it from other equivariant categories relating to the behavior of its geometric fixed points."
"We prove that Morel-Voevodsky's stable $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory affords the universal coefficient system, giving rise to Grothendieck's six operations."
"We show existence of a natural rational structure on periodic cyclic homology, conjectured by L. Katzarkov, M. Kontsevich, T. Pantev, for several classes of dg-categories, including proper connective $\mathbb{C}$-dg-algebras and dg-categories of local systems. The main ingredient is derived nilpotent invariance of A. Blanc's semi-topological K-theory, which we establish along the way."
"We define a notion of colimit for diagrams in a motivic category indexed by a presheaf of spaces (e.g. an \'etale classifying space), and we study basic properties of this construction. As a case study, we construct the motivic analogs of the classical extended and generalized powers, which refine the categorical versions of these constructions as special cases. We also offer more computationally tractable models of these constructions using equivariant motivic homotopy theory. This is the first in a series of papers on power operations in motivic stable homotopy theory."
Following Eilenberg-Steenrod axiomatic approach we construct the universal ordinary homology theory for any homological structure on a given category by representing ordinary theories with values in abelian categories. For a convenient category of spaces we then obtain a universal abelian category which can be actually described for CW-complexes as the category of hieratic modules.
Smooth and proper dg-algebras have an Euler class valued in the Hochschild homology of the algebra. This Euler class is worthy of this name since it satisfies many familiar properties including compatibility with the familiar pairing on the Hochschild homology of the algebra and that of its opposite. This compatibility is the Riemann-Roch theorems of Shklyarov and Petit.   In this paper we prove a broad generalization of these Riemann-Roch theorems. We generalize from the bicategory of dg-algebras and their bimodules to monoidal bicategories and from Euler class to traces of non identity maps. Our generalization also implies spectral Riemann-Roch theorems.   We regard this result as an instantiation of a 2-dimensional generalized cobordism hypothesis. This perspective draws the result close to many others that generalize results about Euler characteristics and classes to bicategorical traces.
"Small, finite entities are easier and simpler to manipulate than gigantic, infinite ones. Consequently huge chunks of mathematics are devoted to methods reducing the study of big, cumbersome objects to an analysis of their finite building blocks. The manifestation of this general pattern, in the study of derived and triangulated categories, dates back almost to the beginnings of the subject -- more precisely to articles by Illusie in SGA6, way back in the early 1970s.   What's new, at least new in the world of derived and triangulated categories, is that one gets extra mileage from analysing more carefully and quantifying more precisely just how efficiently one can estimate infinite objects by finite ones. This leads one to the study of metrics on triangulated categories, and of how accurately an object can be approximated by finite objects of bounded size."
"We construct a monoidal model structure on the category of all curved coalgebras and show that it is Quillen equivalent, via the extended bar-cobar adjunction, to another model structure we construct on the category of curved algebras. When the coalgebras under consideration are conilpotent and the algebras are dg, i.e. uncurved, this corresponds to the ordinary dg Koszul duality of Positselski and Keller-Lef\`evre. As an application we construct global noncommutative moduli spaces for flat connections on vector bundles, holomorphic structures on almost complex vector bundles, dg modules over a dg algebra, objects in a dg category, and others."
"Let $(\mathcal{G},\otimes)$ be any closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category. We show that K-flat covers exist universally in the category of chain complexes and that the Verdier quotient of $K(\mathcal{G})$ by the K-flat complexes is always a well generated triangulated category. Under the further assumption that $\mathcal{G}$ has a set of $\otimes$-flat generators we can show more: (i) The category is in recollement with the $\otimes$-pure derived category and the usual derived category, and (ii) The usual derived category is the homotopy category of a cofibrantly generated and monoidal model structure whose cofibrant objects are precisely the K-flat complexes. We also give a condition guaranteeing that the right orthogonal to K-flat is precisely the acyclic complexes of $\otimes$-pure injectives. We show this condition holds for quasi-coherent sheaves over a quasi-compact and semiseparated scheme."
"Enriched motivic $\mathcal A$-spaces are introduced and studied in this paper, where $\mathcal A$ is an additive category of correspondences. They are linear counterparts of motivic $\Gamma$-spaces. It is shown that rational special enriched motivic $\widetilde{\mathrm{Cor}}$-spaces recover connective motivic bispectra with rational coefficients, where $\widetilde{\mathrm{Cor}}$ is the category of Milnor--Witt correspondences."
In this note we define a notion of Courant pair as a Courant algebra over the Lie algebra of linear derivations on an associative algebra. We study formal deformations of Courant pairs by constructing a cohomology bicomplex with coefficients in a module from the cochain complexes defining Hochschild cohomology and Leibniz cohomology.
"Let N be the set of non-negative integer numbers, T the circle group and c the cardinality of the continuum. Given an abelian group G of size at most 2^c and a countable family F of infinite subsets of G, we construct ""Baire many"" monomorphisms p: G --> T^c such that p(E) is dense in {y in T^c : ny=0} whenever n in N, E in F, nE={0} and {x in E: mx=g} is finite for all g in G and m such that n=mk for some k in N--{1}. We apply this result to obtain an algebraic description of countable potentially dense subsets of abelian groups, thereby making a significant progress towards a solution of a problem of Markov going back to 1944. A particular case of our result yields a positive answer to a problem of Tkachenko and Yaschenko. Applications to group actions and discrete flows on T^c, diophantine approximation, Bohr topologies and Bohr compactifications are also provided."
"The purpose of this expository paper is to present new directions in the classical Nielsen-Reidemeister fixed point theory. We describe twisted Burnside-Frobenius theorem, groups with $R_\infty$ \emph{property} and a connection between Nielsen fixed point theory and symplectic Floer homology."
"Let $U$ be a Banach Lie group and $G\le U$ a compact subgroup. We show that closed Lie subgroups of $U$ contained in sufficiently small neighborhoods $V\supseteq G$ are compact, and conjugate to subgroups of $G$ by elements close to $1\in U$; this generalizes a well-known result of Montgomery and Zippin's from finite- to infinite-dimensional Lie groups. Along the way, we also prove an approximate counterpart to Jordan's theorem on finite subgroups of general linear groups: finite subgroups of $U$ contained in sufficiently small neighborhoods $V\supseteq G$ have normal abelian subgroups of index bounded in terms of $G\le U$ alone.   Additionally, various spaces of compact subgroups of $U$, equipped with the Hausdorff metric attached to a complete metric on $U$, are shown to be analytic Banach manifolds; this is the case for both (a) compact groups of a given, fixed dimension, or (b) compact (possibly disconnected) semisimple subgroups. Finally, we also prove that the operation of taking the centralizer (or normalizer) of a compact subgroup of $U$ is continuous (respectively upper semicontinuous) in the appropriate sense."
"Given a finite group G, we develop a theory of G-equivariant noncommutative motives. This theory provides a well-adapted framework for the study of G-schemes, Picard groups of schemes, G-algebras, 2-cocycles, equivariant algebraic K-theory, orbifold cohomology theory, etc. Among other results, we relate our theory with its commutative counterpart as well as with Panin's motivic theory. As a first application, we extend Panin's computations, concerning twisted projective homogeneous varieties, to a large class of invariants. As a second application, we prove that whenever the category of perfect complexes of a G-scheme X admits a full exceptional collection of G-invariant (different from G-equivariant) objects, the G-equivariant Chow motive of X is of Lefschetz type. Finally, we construct a G-equivariant motivic measure with values in the Grothendieck group of G-equivariant noncommutative Chow motives."
